00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.560
Doing this a little bit more formally, so we're going to represent our signal as

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.110
an infinite weighted sum of an infinite number of sinusoids.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.160
So the Fourier Transform, here it is,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.100
in it's beautiful glory, in one dimension, okay.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.630
F of u is a Fourier transform.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.350
We just take the infinite integral of the original function times e to

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.620
the minus i 2 pi, u x.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.740
You might say, what?

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.296
Where did that e to the minus i, [SOUND] come from?

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.731
&gt;&gt; Where did that come from?

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:33.020
&gt;&gt; Oh, see, she didn't fall into that trap.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.040
Well again, remember from your probably calculus class,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.330
somewhere e to the i k is cosine k plus i sine k.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.250
That's why this is the even part and that's the odd part.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.860
This is where i is the square root of minus 1.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.760
By the way, if there are any electrical engineers out there,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.660
they have j as being the square root of minus 1.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.640
I don't know why, because mathematicians use i,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.630
I guess electrical engineers didn't like the mathematicians.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.270
We're going to use i.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.900
So what the Fourier transform does, is it converts from the spatial domain

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.510
into the frequency domain, and the frequency domain is either written as omega,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.130
sometimes as u, as we're doing here,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.710
sometimes even s when you're talking about loss transforms and stuff like that.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.780
But the idea is that this cap f is the frequency spectrum, or I should say it's,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.200
it's frequency of f of omega, but we're going to talk about its magnitude in

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.670
a minute, which is going to be sort of what we, we refer to as this spectrum.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.970
Just for completeness, by the way, so here we had the Fourier transform.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.330
This is the inverse Fourier transform.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.530
Unsurprisingly, if you tell me what all of the sinusoids are,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.250
if I sum them all up, okay, at some location x, and

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.440
I sum up over all the sinusoids, I can recover the original signal.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.590
And that's called the inverse Fourier Transform.
