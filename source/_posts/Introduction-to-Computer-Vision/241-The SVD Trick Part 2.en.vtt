00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.830
Now you might ask, why are we doing that transformation?

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.030
&gt;&gt; Why are we doing that transformation?

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.080
&gt;&gt; Here's why.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.490
It's going to let us do some very cool substitution.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.220
So we're minimizing DV-transpose m.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.526
Let's do a substitution of y equals V-transpose m.

00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:20.658
So now we're minimizing just Dy.

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:24.860
Subject to the magnitude of y equals 1.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.070
Right? because V transpose M is y.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.800
Its magnitude has to be 1.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.450
Okay.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.270
So y is a unit vector.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:32.810
Why?

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.370
Why not?

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.360
No, never mind.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.310
Because it is.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.330
All right?

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.270
But think about D times y.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.420
All right?

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.130
Dy right there.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:49.140
Remember, D is a diagonal matrix whose elements are in decreasing order.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.800
So, what is the smallest that Dy can be?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.760
When is it the minimum?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.260
Well, it's going to be a minimum when y puts all of its weight,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.810
remember y is the unit vector, just in that last element, all right?

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.150
So the best y for minimizing Dy given that D is a decreasing order

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.050
diagonal matrix is just 0,0,0,0,0,1 okay.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.870
That's the y that minimizes Dy.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.560
And, since we defined y to be V transpose m, then m is equal to Vy.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.690
Why?

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.670
Well, remember I said that V is orthogonal.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.780
Right. So when V is orthogonal its transpose is its inverse.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.360
So if y is equal to V transpose m,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.740
the inverse of that is just V, so m is equal to Vy.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.750
So now we've solved for m in terms of y, but, V and y, but remember.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.010
Y is just 0,0,0, all the way 0,1.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.288
So that means that this equation just pulls out the last column in V.

00:01:57.288 --> 00:02:01.610
All right, because if I take a matrix, all right, and

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.820
I multiply it by some vector that's all zeroes down to 1.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.520
That 1 just multiplies the last column.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.420
So I just pull out the last column.
