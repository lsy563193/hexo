00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.500
So here is a a very
interesting line drawing.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.880
It's, it's a line with two parts and
notice it has a corner.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.670
And here's the next one.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.140
Voila, it moved.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.000
Back, forth, back, forth.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.530
I could do this all day, okay?

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.950
And you can see it moving, okay?

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.140
Great, let me put an aperture over that.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.790
So here is a great big green aperture,
all right?

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.980
And now, I'm going to move
that line thing the same way.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.610
And now it goes like this, whoa.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.450
Now it's moving up or
at least it feels like it's moving up.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.190
Is it moving up?

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.880
No.
In fact,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.740
here I've made it transparent, okay?

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.578
So now, this is the same motion, right?

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:46.154
If you, fact, if you look at the corner,

00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:48.420
you can tell this thing is moving
over and down a little bit.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.795
But if you were to look just inside the
circle, it looks like it's moving up.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:58.620
Not down and over,
that's the aperture problem, okay?

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.800
You can only tell the motion locally in
the direction perpendicular to the edge.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.600
There are some other effects of getting,
sort of, strong gradient flow.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.330
So this is a, single pattern and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.070
then I'm going to use Power Point to
just put this in motion using animation.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.930
So there's no video going on here, this
thing is just moving back and forth.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.950
And hopefully, as you see this move,
you, every time it bumps,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.080
you're going to see the inside
move relative to the surround.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.940
It's not actually moving,
that's in your head and

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.500
that's because of various noise and
various ways of computing the gradient.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.650
Like more details and it's not,
it's just not the aperture problem.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.110
But it's showing the sensitivity in
your mind, in your head of the gradient.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.250
The aperture problem also is sometimes
used to explain the barber pole

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.130
illusion, right?

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.880
So it's spinning around but
you see stripes going up.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.040
And in fact,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.030
in the you shouldn't believe
everything you see on the web universe.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.990
Some people will say that
the aperture problem explains

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.580
the barber pole illusion but
actually that's not really true.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.650
It has to do with it, it doesn't explain
it, because if you think about it,

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.210
the gradients here are not
quite vertical, right?

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.980
They are off a little bit and so
you can get a flow that's like that.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.600
And you have to do some integration

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.060
to decide that the whole
thing is moving up.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.790
And actually, Ellen Hildreth,
a very long time ago and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.880
her PhD thesis looked at how
you use the normal flow.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.880
And you can integrate it in
order to make the, the, the,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.990
you might see the pole move up.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.270
But it is the case that there are places

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.210
out there that will tell you that
this is because of the, the vectors.
