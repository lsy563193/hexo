00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.300
The discrete Fourier transform is what we have to do when we want to start

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.670
doing things in computers because after all we don't have continuous signals,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.220
we only have discrete values.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.170
So the discrete Fourier transform is written as this.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.450
Now we say F of k,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.520
where k in this case would be the discrete frequency, all right?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.080
And, what we're going to do is we're going to sum over all the pixels, so

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.010
we're having x going from, or signal N-1d in this case,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.530
from 0 through N minus 1 if I have a total of N of them.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.610
So there's this 1 over N out here.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.410
And now we have this e to the minus i.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.680
And you see how it's k over N?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.700
Because basically,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.780
instead of now thinking of frequency as how quickly it wiggles in terms of time,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.700
it's sort of, how quickly you wiggle over the entire length of the image.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.190
So, k is written as, it's the number of cycles per period of the signal,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.710
or per period of the image, all right?

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.030
Cycles per image.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.340
This only makes sense essentially from 0, up to N over 2.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.790
Why only N over 2?

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.470
Well, think about how quickly a sinusoid could

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.530
possibly wiggle in a image that has N pixels, right?

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.230
Well, it would go white, all the way to black, all the way to white,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.510
all the way to black, all the way.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.510
So it, that would be a period of ha, of, of 2.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.140
So the frequency, the number of cycles, would be N over 2.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.670
So basically, k can only go from minus N over 2 to plus N over 2,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.280
because that's the highest frequency you can have in a discrete image.
