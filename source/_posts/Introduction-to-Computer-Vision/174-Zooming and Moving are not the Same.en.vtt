00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.360
So, here's something cool that's related to the mathematics of photography which

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.480
we'll do more of.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.320
And it's that zooming and moving are not the same thing, right.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.080
So some people think oh if I zoom in,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.810
it's just like getting closer to something.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.220
Well, it's not true.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.800
Here are two pictures of the same car.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.380
Okay?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.420
And you can tell already that they look somehow different even though it's

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.080
the same car, and the car is in the same place.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.210
And the reason that they're different, is that on the left,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.930
the car was taken with a very large field of view.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.180
So that's a very small focal length.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.500
So that means the photographer had to get close to the car.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.070
Okay.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.980
The image on the right was taken with a small field of view,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.040
a larger focal length, so the photographer had to back away from the car.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.920
So even though that the car is the same size in the image,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.710
you'll notice right away, that the shape seems quite different, all right?

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.050
The one on the left seems to have what,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.730
a lot of what's called perspective distortion, and

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.760
it's not really distortion at all.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.050
It's just the effect of perspective.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.590
And that's why I said,

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.800
we're going to do the mathematics of that, really not today.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.560
We'll, we're going to do that in the next one.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.870
This has dramatic effect on taking pictures of people as well.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.012
So here is a example again taken from the, the web, the website in

00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:19.400
there says StevenEastwood.com where it has tutorials on lens perspective.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.780
What we have here is pictures of the same woman.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.320
But over here, it's a 350 millimeter lens.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.770
Standing very far away zoomed in, here is a 19 millimeter lens

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.930
standing much closer in order to be able to get the same size face.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.260
And you'll notice that you get this incredible apparent change of the shape

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.870
of her face.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.620
And over here that's referred to, again, as perspective distortion.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.970
But that's not really a correct word.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.920
It's just the effect of perspective.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.240
This is why photographers use particular lenses for portrait work.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.740
And they tend to pick a lens that let's them stand,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.650
what they call a normal distance away.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.840
It turns out when you and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.350
I think about what a picture of somebody should look like, we tend to think of

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.940
what it looks like standing somewhere around six, seven, eight feet away.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.000
Or maybe a little bit further, but certainly not closer.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.040
And that's why they pick the particular lenses that they do.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.180
Here's another example of what's called the effect of focal length

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.410
on perspective.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.560
And here it's being called correct perspective effect.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.270
And this is a image out of the Zisserman and Hartley book.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.160
They're actually talking about the effect of perspective and weak perspective.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.630
We'll talk about that actually next lecture.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.450
But here two pictures of the same building.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.190
Again one taken with a much wider field of view lens.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.770
So the one on the left, so you see this effect as the object gets smaller away.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.260
And with a telephoto lens,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.520
where the image on the right, you don't see any converging of the lines.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.570
And we'll talk about the mathematics of that next time.
