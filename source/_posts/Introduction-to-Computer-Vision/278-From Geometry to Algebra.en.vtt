00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.309
So here we start our little mathematical foray down into making it

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:04.689
from geometry to algebra.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.570
So I just wrote what we had before.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.563
The X prime, the position or location of X in the prime frame can

00:00:11.563 --> 00:00:16.842
just be expressed just having rotated the X frame by the R amount and

00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:18.930
then translating it by T.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.750
All right?

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.370
Great.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.949
Let's just cross both sides of that equation by T.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.134
So we have T cross X prime on the left, but on the right, we have T cross and

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:36.090
it's just, because of distributive property it's T cross RX plus T cross T.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.750
All right?

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.090
And by the way, I, I wrote here that this is normal to the plane.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.488
Remember that T cross X prime is going to be something that's perpendicular to

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:45.421
both of them, so

00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:50.170
that would be perpendicular to the epipolar plane that, that we're showing here.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.267
We'll, we'll maybe make use of that in a minute, but

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:53.509
I just want you to realize that.

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:57.309
More importantly, what you should see is that we've got T cross T here.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.850
What's T cross T?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.930
Not very much.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.610
Otherwise, known as zero.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.530
Okay?

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.830
So that just means that T cross X prime is equal to T cross RX, got it?

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.570
Okay.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.289
Now let's take both sides of that equation and I'm going to dot it with X prime.

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.829
So we got X prime dot T cross X prime equals X prime dot T cross RX.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.570
I sure hope you're reading this, because listening to me sounds ridiculous.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.450
Okay?

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.510
Well, let's take a look at this left-hand side.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.090
Okay?

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.002
T cross X prime gives us what?

00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:39.031
Well, it gives us a vector that's perpendicular to the plane containing T and

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:39.649
X prime.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.809
So it's perpendicular to T and it's perpendicular to X prime.

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:46.090
And then I dotted it with X prime, so what am I going to get?

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.490
Zero, right?

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.850
because it's perpendicular and if everything goes well, there it is in yellow.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.190
Zero is equal to X prime dot T times RX.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.050
Okay?

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.590
So far so good?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.090
Good.
