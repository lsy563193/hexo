00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.170
What actually happens in Lambertian shading is the following.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.270
Okay, when the light is reflected out, basically it falls off, so

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.140
there's, it, it's sort of equal area here.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.870
So you see this amount?

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.840
So more light is reflected perpendicularly out than is reflected sideways.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.500
Okay? And in fact,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.200
as you fall off this thing goes down by the cosine of the angle.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.690
So that actually almost no light at all goes out sideways.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.700
So a lot of light reflects back up and almost no light at all reflects sideways.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.800
So you might ask.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.950
Get ready Megan.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.480
Well why does it look equally bright from all directions?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.030
&gt;&gt; Well why does it look equally bright from all directions?

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.640
&gt;&gt; I love it when stuff works.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.720
It's that same foreshortening effect, but

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.930
this time it goes the other way around, right?

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.470
If I've got sort of a pixel having a particular angle, so that's what

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.240
this is meant to be, a pixel having an angle, when I look down through here.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.010
It has a smaller area.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.570
It's drawn sort of wrong here.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.170
Than when I look this way.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.260
Think about it this way.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.960
If I had a camera out here, the same angle,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.290
right, would now get a much bigger area coming into the same pixel.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.570
So if I understand the math right, and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.480
I think I do, what this means is, is that.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.740
The amount of area that I see on the surface grows by the cosine of that area.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.580
Or I should say one over the cosine of that angle.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.720
So as that angle gets smaller and gets closer and closer to 90 degrees,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.489
right, I start to see an infinite amount of patch in the same little pixel,

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:45.070
but over here I'm putting out smaller and smaller and smaller light.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.350
And these cosines, in fact here they are here, this one and that one.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.140
They cancel.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.790
And that's why it looks equally bright from every direction.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.970
So, I think I got that right.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.620
I'm sure my computer vision colleagues are going to send me email, or

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.810
just make fun of me on the web if I got that wrong but I'm pretty sure that,

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.740
that's the way it works.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.800
What you need to know is that it appears equally bright from all directions.
