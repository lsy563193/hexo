00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.576
I should mention that, there've been other attempts at not,

00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:06.630
the other pieces of work on finding corners.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.730
In fact, Shi-Tomasi did this nice work on, cornerness, and

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.050
it, it did something different looking at the lambdas,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.880
instead of using that r, and found local maximums.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.470
And, I will tell you, if any of you who use OpenCV,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.540
they have something called OpenCV Good Features to Track, it's a function, it

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.480
finds you points in the image, that are good features to, good points to track.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.320
How does it work?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.220
I'm pretty sure that's the Shi and Tomasi version of this.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.670
It's still based upon the same moment matrix,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.800
it's just a different use of the eigenvalues.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.870
And, there's reports that maybe it's a slightly better way for

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.820
things that are undergoing certain kinds of deformations.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.820
There was another one 2005 Brown, Szeliski and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.048
Winder, and I write this one because I've stolen so many of these pictures from

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.830
Rick Szeliski's book, I feel like I have to put this in there.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.206
It again looked at eigenvectors in another slightly different way, and

00:00:55.206 --> 00:00:58.247
there are other, types of, of corner detectors.
