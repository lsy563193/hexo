00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.300
The first thing we have to do is
define what's called optical flow or

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.689
optic flow.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.930
Because what we're going to be
recovering today is the optic flow.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.480
And the optic flow is the apparent
motion of objects or surfaces or pixels.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.010
And the reason I say
apparent will be clear.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.560
Here what we have is a Rubik's
cube looking device,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.410
although here it's black and white, so
it's just a denuded Rubik's cube and

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.020
it's been placed on a turntable
that's been rotating around this way.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.070
If you take a look at these little.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.920
Patterns on the side,
you can see what the rotation is.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.630
I'm pretty sure this was done by Rick
Zalesky because he's looked at these

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.000
gray codes to do the rotation.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.240
Now what's a little bit hard to see is
that over here are these little arrows

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.390
that are showing you the motion.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.100
And of course the motion is greater at
the front of the turntable than say,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.770
on the cube, because it's closer to you
and it's rotating a further distance.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.042
But you'll notice that there
are no arrows up here.

00:00:57.042 --> 00:01:00.130
All right,
on the white part of the turntable.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.209
Now, it's moving exactly the same way as
the part of the turntable that has the,

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.269
the markings on it.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.910
But you can't see it.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.590
There's no apparent motion, 'because
there's no contrast, there's no texture.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.860
There's no indication that
the pattern is moving.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.640
So, optic slow is recovering
the apparent motion.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.560
Of objects or points or surfaces.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.670
The actual motion, by the way,
is sometimes called the motion field.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.180
We're not going to
talk about that today,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.590
we're we'll talk about that not next
time, but time after, a little bit.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.680
But what the underlying
physical motion is.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.420
Today we're talking about
motion in the image.
