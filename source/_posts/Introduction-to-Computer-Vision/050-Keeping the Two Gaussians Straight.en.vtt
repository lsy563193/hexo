00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.880
Finally, a word of warning or clarification at least.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.500
We just talked about sigma as being the width of a Gaussian,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.170
where that was the variance of the, of the smoo, smoothing of the blurring.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.150
Last time we talked about sigma or sigma squared as the variance of

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.420
a noise function, how much noise was being added.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.005
So in one case, where we share might the filter, the sigma is in space, okay?

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:30.580
Where as in the noise case it's in an intensity or itâ€™s in the value.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.600
The bigger the noise signal is, the more noise you added,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.060
the bigger the blurring filter sigma, the more you're going to blur.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.039
So, you have to be an in a reasonable called sigma as they're both

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.460
using a normal distribution.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.600
But one is over a space, and one is over intensity.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600
We can show those two sigmas here, and by the way,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.778
here I'm using I'm using images that go from zero to one.

00:00:50.778 --> 00:00:54.740
Partially because that I know how sigma varies with respect to the range of

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.520
the image, and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.122
partially because the slides that I stole off the Internet did this.

00:00:58.122 --> 00:00:59.150
All right?

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.910
So in the top row, there's no smoothing going on,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.330
so we have a sigma of 0.2 in the noise.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.545
That's a lot of noise if the range is only going from 0 to 1 or,

00:01:10.545 --> 00:01:12.728
or let's say minus 0.5 to 0.5.

00:01:12.728 --> 00:01:15.840
A sigma 0.1 is less noise.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.020
A sigma 0.05 is less noise yet.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.885
But then we can smooth it, all right, with a Gaussian.

00:01:22.885 --> 00:01:25.660
Right, this is the smoothing, with the Gaussian kernel.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.440
And the more we smooth, the blurrier these things get.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.410
And so, for the same amount of smoothing, the thing with the smaller amount of

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.480
noise, with the same amount of smoothing becomes even smoother, right?

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.200
So this image here is even smoother than that image there.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.850
Okay?

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.030
But this is showing you those two sigmas, the two Gaussians.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.800
Almost always it'll be clear from context, but

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.550
since I've had situations where students say,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.010
wait a minute, I thought the bigger signal was, the more noise we got.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.640
Now you're telling me the more sigma is, the more blurring is,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.160
the less noise we have, and I say yep, two sigmas.
