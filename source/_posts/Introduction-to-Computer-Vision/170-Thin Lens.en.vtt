00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.470
In computational photography,

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.960
it's common to make what's known as a thin lens assumption.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.119
So a thin lens assumption is basically the drawing that I

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.620
just showed you before.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.170
Where we say okay, for given lens with a given focal point,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.340
it's going to image some object at let's say distance, d0,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.024
at some distance di, or, or for d for image, back.

00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:23.610
And the question is can we predict,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.710
from the focal point what the relationship is between d0 and di?

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.880
Well obviously the answer is yes, or I wouldn't have been wasting all this film.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.730
Or, I waste your time.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.714
So here's a thin film lens diagram taken from the slides by a Forsyth for

00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:43.450
their textbook, and we're going to use that to derive the relationship

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.250
between distance in the world.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.280
And which we're going to call here z, away from the,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.720
the center of the lens, to the distance z prime,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.470
which is where the image will be focused, and the focal length, f.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.650
First, just to be clear, here is some point p that's at some height y,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.350
since we're just going to look at that side.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.240
We're going to assume that it's projected at some point p prime, that is,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.810
y prime.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.380
Off of here.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.060
And here is our focal length, f.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.700
All right?

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.170
The idea is that all parallel rays are going to intersect f.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.340
Okay? Which is why this one goes back here this way as well.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.230
All right?

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.710
So when we have all sorts of parallel lines and that are going through the same

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.780
point, it's easy to reason about what's going on here using similar triangles.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.870
So here we have our similar triangle.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.660
And it basically says that y is to z as y prime is to z prime.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.650
Two things to note here.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.190
First of all, I only use the magnitude of z and

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.570
z prime, because we're only going to worry about the length.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.180
And I probably could have used the magnitude of y prime, but

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.840
just to make it clear that the y value is inverted,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.900
I set negative y prime as being a positive value.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.750
So if y is positive, then y prime would be negative.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.230
If y is negative, then y prime would be positive and thus the negative sign.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.920
All right, so that's our first similar triangle.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.570
Our next similar triangle is here.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.670
And that says, and this one's a little bit trickier.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.460
Again, the ratio between y prime and y is the same as

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.770
the ratio between z minus f, so that's this amount, right?

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.250
All of z minus f, is to f.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.830
So y is to f.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.530
All right. So just look that a little bit.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.240
So y prime, size of y prime is to y as z prime minus f is to f.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.220
So that gives us a second set of similar triangles.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.180
Combining these two formulas gives us this formula.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.390
Not rocket science here,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.470
we're just setting the two left hands sides are the same, so

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.640
we set the two right hand sides equal to the same.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.430
We continue, we play around with the math a little bit.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.950
And we get this very simple formula.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.531
That 1 over the magnitude of z prime plus 1

00:02:57.531 --> 00:03:01.170
over the magnitude of z equals 1 over f.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.260
That's the thin lens equation, and

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.100
any points that satisfy that equation are in focus, okay.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.760
So if my film plane, on a thin lens assumption or a thin lens model.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.110
If my film plane is z prime away from the lens for

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.920
a focal length f, then everything that is z away will be in focus.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.060
So by moving the lens in and out a little bit from my film plane,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.360
I change where in the world things are in focus.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.060
So I can change the z prime easily.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.120
I can move the, the lens in and out from where my film plate is and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.510
that changes the points out in the world that are in focus.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.900
There's a cool little thin lens app.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.730
It took me four times to say that before I got it right.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.300
It's posted here on the Web and it just let's you sort of

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.417
play around with how you change the geometry of what's going to happen.
