00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.430
So let's talk a little bit about stereovision.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.970
How do humans do it?

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.550
And at the very,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.990
very end of the course we'll talk about the physiology of the human system.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.830
But today I just want to talk about the computation.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.930
If you think about it,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.690
you can imagine that stereo is done a couple of different ways.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.720
One way might be that you sort of find some regions in one image and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.880
then you find those regions in the other image and your brain compares them and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.390
sees how they've shifted relative to each other and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.790
then somehow find, figure out the depth.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.610
Another possibility is that maybe you just process the very

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.320
low level images doing some sort of a comparison and get the depth.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:48.480
So you do fusion first, and then you do recognition.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.880
So if theres a question of whether you do monocular recognition and

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.730
then fuse, or you fuse the images and

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.910
then do binocular, that is given the fused images to the recognition.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.970
So back in the 60s a psychophysicist named Bela Julesz wanted to

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.620
look at this question.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.680
So to test this he made a pair of synthetic images which were

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.540
obtained by essentially spraying black dots on white objects.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.220
All right?

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.535
So here's a notional description comes from the Forsyth and Ponce book.

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:20.230
Of sort of putting imagine that those are white and you sprinkled pepper or

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.730
you sprinkled black dots all over the whole thing.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.620
And you took one picture from this side and another picture from that side.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.520
What you'd get are these two images.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.200
Okay?

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.420
Now, when you look at those two images you don't see anything in there.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.080
But if I showed them to you in stereo, which is very difficult for

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.140
me to do here you would actually see that block raised.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.900
All right.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.760
So what we can do is we can animate those we can

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.830
animate random dot stereograms in the same way that we animated the swimmer.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.420
I don't have animations of this one, but I do have animations here of this well,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.160
if you look at this for a little while I hope you'll see a shark.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.970
So everybody see the shark?

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.050
Okay. So this is the, the heads sort of sticking out.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.820
Then it bends around and then the tail sticks out again.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.970
So you'll notice, notice I just drew that tail.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.060
Okay.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.610
But of course the tail is not in any individual picture.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.490
It's only in understanding the difference between them.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.380
Now this was actually done from what's called an autostereogram website.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.390
You can go take a look.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.860
There are ways of making these so

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.000
that if you just, you can use the same picture, cross your eyes, or,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.570
or stare at them differently that you'll get different images in the two eyes.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.630
But I think you get the idea that from these two images, you can see the depth.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.000
And what's interesting is if I present one to one eye and

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.850
one to the other, you see that depth.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.040
So the answer to Ullage's question was whether you process the image first

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.630
finding these regions and then line them up to do the stereo.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.430
Or you first line up the sort of little, local pixel area in order to do the,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.090
the stereo, it's clear that you do that first.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.240
You don't have, you, that you do the stereo first.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.960
You don't have to have any specific objects or region.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.060
Sort of a clean way of saying it is that human binocular fusion,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.749
fusing the two together, is not based upon matching large-scale structures.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.550
Or any individual process of the image is actually based on

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.450
a low-level process that directly fuses the two images.
