00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.022
So, in general, if the case of two calibrated cameras.

00:00:05.022 --> 00:00:09.302
We had talked about parallel optical axes, all right.

00:00:09.302 --> 00:00:11.730
So that they were lined up and the parallel, and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.360
the planes were, were coplanar, but of course, they can be what's called verged.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.460
They could be pointed in some particular way.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.640
In fact, they don't even have to necessarily be verged on the same point.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.070
Usually they are because we're used to human systems.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.620
But what we're going to do is we're going to talk about epipolar geometry,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.049
the epipolar constraint in both of these cases.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.362
So let's start it this way.

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:39.191
So if I have an image on the left and some point p projecting in that image,

00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:45.350
the question is where can p prime the image of that same point on the right be?

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.330
Well, basically the actual scene point could be

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.240
anywhere along the ray that contains p prime.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.250
Each of these red dots correspond to possible locations along that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.740
ray of the actual scene point that's projecting to p prime.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.989
Now remember, in perspective projection,

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.910
one of the things we said was that lines project into lines.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.560
So the line containing the center of projection and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.497
the ray that goes through that point, that's a real line in space, okay?

00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:26.980
That line mu, in, must project into a line in the right image.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.190
So that's the constraint we are going to talk more about.
