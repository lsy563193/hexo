00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.590
Finally, two more surveillance is a huge issue.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.950
This ideas of being able to monitor environment for

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.350
crowd safety, a variety of reasons.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.591
These are screenshots taken from Siemens sells a system for

00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:14.100
doing port monitoring.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.320
Just to know whether, say, people are loitering, or

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.420
vehicles are approaching that aren't supposed to be.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.450
This is also a computer vision.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.180
A more direct effect on a single individual with computer vision is work in

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.440
medical imagining.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.570
Okay, so here you see an example.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.200
There's all sorts of 3D imaging, MRI, CAT scan,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.750
stuff like that, but here you see some work.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.420
This came out of Eric Grimson's lab a while ago at MIT where on a screen,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.180
a the computer vision system is registering the skull

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.620
that's on the table with a model that has been created from the 3D imaging.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.340
So while, when the surgeon looks at this monitor, he sees the real person, and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.800
by the way, if there were a scalpel here, he'd see the hand with the scalpel or

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.490
drill or whatever you're using to make a hole in the person's head.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.430
And where the various structures are underneath that you wanted to see, and

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.019
that's also computer vision.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.300
Look, this is just a quick taste of the state of the art,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.350
hopefully, it inspires you.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.980
One of the things I want you to realize is that

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.950
almost everything that I showed you here is less than ten years only, and

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.580
in fact, many of them are less than five years old.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.290
So the field is rapidly changing, and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.320
there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in computer vision right now, so

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.770
this is exactly the right time for you to take this class.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.286
So that you can invent some cool technology.

00:01:28.286 --> 00:01:30.900
Make, $3 gazillion and

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.430
send a very large donation to the people who made it possible.
