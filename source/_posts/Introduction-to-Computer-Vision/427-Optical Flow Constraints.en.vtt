00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's look at these equations
a little more carefully.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.470
So the brightness constancy equation.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:12.150
What we're going to do is assume we know
that some pixel is moving in amount u v.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.190
U is the amount in x, v is the amount
of y when we get to t plus 1.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.420
Okay?

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.500
The brightness constant, constraint
equation can be written like this,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.520
I of x,y,t that is,
the image at time t, at location x,y,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.387
brightness if it's gray-scale, color if
it's color, is going to be the same at t

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:38.020
plus 1 at location x plus u, y plus v,
where u and v are the amount

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.520
the point has moved in the x direction
and the y direction respectively.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.530
So that's called the brightness
constancy constraint and in fact I can

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.940
rewrite it like this, 0 is equal to
the x plus u, y plus v, t plus 1 image.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.524
Minus the original i of x,y,t.

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:57.620
All right, that's the brightness
constancy constraint.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.320
The second assumption was that we get
a very small amount of motion, okay?

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.129
So that basically, u and v,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.940
let's assume they're, like,
one pixel, or part of a pixel.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.310
Or just, things are changing smoothly.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.070
Yes you know it's coming.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.230
What that means is I can estimate
using the Taylor expansion here

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.850
that the value of an image displaced
from x by u and displaced from,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.160
from y by v, is approximately,
well it's exactly here if I order terms.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.590
It's the original value plus
the gradient x times delta x,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.930
plus the gradient y times delta y.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.180
U and v are delta x and

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.175
delta y, respectively,
plus some high order terms.

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:42.915
Right?

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:44.195
Remember Taylor expansion?

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:46.875
If you go infinite series,
you get the exact solution,

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:49.705
but we're just going to say
plus some high order terms.

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:53.565
And then when we make those high
order terms go away, poof, wow.

00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:54.375
Isn't that great?

00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:56.135
I've got the power right here.

00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:56.855
All right?

00:01:56.855 --> 00:01:59.770
Then we say that it's an approximation.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.700
Okay, so we say that x plus u, y plus
v is approximately the original image

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.500
plus the gradient in x times delta x
plus the gradient y times delta y, or v.
