00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.050
So there's a cool way of thinking about image reprojection,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.180
sort of a natural geometry.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.310
The first is, think about take one picture, another picture, another picture and

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.210
you'll see here that all of these pictures were taken by rotating my camera.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.060
And I've drawn it as if my camera's center projection was perfectly aligned.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.820
Of course it's never perfectly, but pretty close.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.750
Although you can buy little tripods that make it

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.860
easy to rotate the camera right above the focal point of the lens.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.490
In fact, if if some of you have a really good camera it'll show you where

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.440
the film plane, or the sensor plane of of of the camera is.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.350
And then if you know the focal length of your camera, of your lens, sorry, you.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.840
Let's suppose it's a 50 millimeter lens, you would measure 50 millimeters from

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.630
that point, and you know that's the focal point of my lens.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.050
And you could set your tripod up so that the axis of rotation is

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.800
right underneath that, and that's how you'd actually do that rotation.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.930
So anyway, so

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.370
we show here that we have three images taken from three different orientations.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.550
Then, what we want is, we're going to project all of

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.170
these images onto some single mosaic projective plane.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.710
All right?

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.550
So here we're showing projecting image one, projecting image two, and

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.690
projecting image three.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.640
All right?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.880
And you're, so the idea is that you're projecting everything down

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880
onto a common plane.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.450
And of course, there is some overlap.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.460
Which is actually a good thing,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.830
because in order to figure this out you're going to need overlap.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.520
But of course you're also going to have to figure out a) how to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.470
transform these images, and b) how to blend them.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.510
So this is way of thinking of mosaics is that these are images that

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.820
are reprojected on a common plane, and the mosaic is formed on that plane.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.440
Before we go further, this only works for sort of a limited field of view.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.300
But you might be thinking to yourself, wait a minute,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.510
can't I take pictures all day?

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.840
Spinning around on my tripod,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.050
now you get to see how much hair I don't have on the back of my head.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.890
I know you've always wondered about this.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.480
Anyway, it feels like you should be able to paste together pictures going all

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.960
the way around.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.500
And you can.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.320
And in fact Photoshop and even little cameras that you buy do this for you.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.560
They're not actually projecting it onto a plane.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.820
They're projecting it onto some other surface like a cylinder.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.020
And then you unwrap the cylinder.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.160
And you get a panorama.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.580
It turns out that's not actually a real picture.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.940
It's sort of a, I mean it's a real picture, it's made up,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.850
but, but it's not a particular scene.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.210
Whereas when you do a panorama onto a plane,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.210
it's as if you had a super wide field of view camera.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.600
So it's, it's two different kinds of things.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.850
But in the,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.650
in the, when you do the really wide ones it maps it on to a cylinder.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.700
So, how are we going to do this, all right?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.190
So here's an example.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.510
Again, courtesy of Steve Sikes.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.850
So what we're going to do is, we're going to take these multiple pictures.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.030
These are from the Great Wall of China.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.290
Thank you Steve.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.620
And, you know, what's drawn here is this idea that we've taken all of

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.780
these pictures from the same center of projection.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.510
So, how do we do this?

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.690
Well, as we talked about before, the projection between two planes,

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.230
shown here as, P prime equals H P, is just a homography.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.420
Remember that from last time?

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.920
A homography that allows us to map from one plane to the next.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.280
In fact, a little bit later I'm going to show you a,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.220
a nice little proof that says a mapping,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.910
a projective mapping between any two planes can be represented as a homography.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.690
But here we've represented it as just H going from one set of points to another.
