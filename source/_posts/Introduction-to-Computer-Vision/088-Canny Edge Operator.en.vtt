00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.090
Now that we know how to compute smooth derivatives and

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.640
gradients, we can return to the question of how do we actually find the edges.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.660
And fundamentally it's a multi-step process, right?

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.140
You're going to create smooth derivatives to suppress sort of little bit

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.760
noise and we're going to compute sort of the main gradients, then we're going to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.060
threshold that gradient somehow to find sort of significant areas of change, and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.180
then we're going to take those areas and then we're going to take those areas

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.650
and we're going to do what's called, thinning and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.300
there's an example of that shown down here, we'll talk more about that, so

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.040
that a fat edge becomes just a single contour, and say that's the edge, and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.200
then finally, we're going to have to somehow connect or

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.650
link those pixels if you actually want to have a connected contour.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.840
So the edge operator I want to talk about is done by John Canny,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.370
actually as his masters, thesis, when I was,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.970
still at school there as well, went on to do some really cool stuff in his PhD,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.640
but everybody knows it because it was called the Canny, edge operator.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.970
And the Canny operator works the following way, you first filter the image with

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.010
derivative of a Gaussian, you find the magnitude and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.000
orientation, then you do what's called non-maximum suppression,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.640
which is this thinning, and we'll talk about that in a minute.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.840
And then, there's a linking operation, we're going to talk about that in detail,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.550
that was really the cool insight, where you're going to define not just one

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.970
threshold, but two, and you're going to use the, the high threshold to start to

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.500
edges, but you'll use the lower threshold to continue.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.970
By the way, MATLAB does Canny edges, so you can just take the Canny edges by

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.420
calling the edge function, and I encourage you to do doc edge or, or help if,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.030
if your doc thing's not set up, to learn all about the edge detection in MATLAB,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.700
it's actually a great source of image processing information,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.370
the documentation of the image processing tool box in MATLAB.
