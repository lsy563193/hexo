00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.150
So before we do think about how we are going to do this in machine,

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.810
what about humans?

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.550
How do humans see in 3D, all right?

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.030
And frankly, we can actually do this using just one eye before we

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.270
even get to two eyes because we in it, we look at these different cues.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.810
So here's an example.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.590
So, when you look at this picture, in fact,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.830
when you look at any flat picture on a piece of paper or on a single screen,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.470
there is only flat real depth, and you see the depth that was in the scene.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.490
So, here we have perspective effect.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.570
You assume that those houses are all the same size, and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.940
their fading off into the distance is what makes them smaller.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.690
So you perceive depth from this perspective effect.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.900
Shading, here's a picture on the left and b and c are some of

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.610
the recovery of using an automatic method to try to recover the depth.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.070
And it's using just the shading information.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.190
You assume that the skin has a particular type of reflectance and

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.160
your brain figures out the, the depth in it.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.380
By the way, this is why certain kinds of makeup is used, right?

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.060
By changing the shading on the cheeks,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.390
you change the apparent shape of the face.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.340
Even though, of course, you didn't change the face,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.890
you just changed the reflection.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.220
Texture, here you see a wall and

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.440
you can tell that the wall is sort of curving around.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.310
And that's because the texture elements on it are changing.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190
Those circles with the little lines on them,

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.680
that's an early attempt at being able to recover orientation from texture.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.600
A more recent piece of work done by Loh, here you have a picture.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600
You see the strawberry and you see the texture.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.740
And the texture changes as the surface tips away from you.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.820
And the system actually works on trying to recover the, the surface height or

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.670
the orientation from the change in texture.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.410
And here's a really cool one.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.670
Remember, we talked about that in real lenses there's a single focal plane

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.800
of depth.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.010
That is, there is some plane out there in the world that's a depth, that,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.480
that's in, that's in focus on the image plane.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.880
And, the more you're away from that particular location,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.550
the more out of focus you become.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.490
So you might be able to take how an image changes focus as you

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.500
change the aperture.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.220
Remember, a very tiny aperture, everything's in focus.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.468
And as you open up the aperture, the depth of field shrinks.

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:20.110
And that means that things that are further away from that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.760
focus plane get fuzzier faster.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.710
So you could actually take multiple images from that same point, change the,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.170
the aperture and figure that out.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.290
So it's a little bit of a cheat.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.970
because yes, it's one eye, but it's multiple pictures, all right?

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.585
Here's an image of them recovering a 3D to shape and depth from a de-focus.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.050
And a last one, and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.120
this is something we're actually going to look at a little bit later.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.950
And in fact, it's actually related to stereo,

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.760
is the idea that from a single eye, if something moves, you can tell the shape.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.900
Now, here's a picture of a statue.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.560
And it's pretty hard for you to figure out the motion that you would use.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.230
Mostly, you're looking at the shading.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.760
So here's a simpler example, all right?

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.280
Now, if all our video gods are working right and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.290
the web is working correctly, and you've got decent bandwidth, and

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.680
the moon is in the sun with the seventh house of Ju, whatever that is.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.440
Anyway, you should all be seeing a rotating cylinder.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.800
Now, some of you are going to be seeing it rotating counter-clockwise and

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.830
some are going to be seeing it rotating clockwise.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.110
And that's because you can't be sure whether the pick, the, the dots moving to

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.570
the right, are in the front of the cylinder, or in the back of the cylinder.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.890
But the idea is, purely from motion, you are seeing this cylinder rotate.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.810
It's pretty amazing actually if you think about it,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.660
and we'll talk a little bit about structure from motion later on in the class.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.870
But the idea is from a single image, but the thing moving, you can get depth.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.380
We're going to come back to that in

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.010
a minute because it's a single image with the thing moving.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.780
Well, we can also have two images where the thing stays the same.
