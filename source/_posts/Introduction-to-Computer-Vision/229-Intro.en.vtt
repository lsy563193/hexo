00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.530
Welcome back introduction computer vision.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.520
Today, we're going to be talking about intrinsic camera calibration.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.350
Last time, we said, that we're going to do geometric calibration in general, and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.710
that there were two parts to calibration.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.760
The first transformation is from some arbitrary world coordinate system,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.700
to the camera system or the camera pose, and this was the extrinsic parameters,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.320
and it mapped from, world coordinates to camera coordinates, or

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.330
camera coordinates to world, depending upon how you think about it.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.570
When we write it as T, W, C, it takes you from the world, to the camera.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.700
We expressed it in terms of homogeneous coordinates,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.980
where we had a world coordinate p here expressed in that world coordinate frame,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.350
and it was homogeneous so there's a one down there.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.900
And we pump it through both the rotation component and the translation component

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.470
to get the three dimensional point in camera coordinates.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.200
And, that world to camera matrix and codes what were referred to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.250
as the extrinsic parameters or the extrinsic parameter matrix.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.060
We also said that,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.128
that encodes six degrees of freedom, three translation, three rotation.

00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:06.650
Today, we're going to talk about the second transformation which goes from

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.490
the 3D camera coordinates to the 2D image coordinates or the 2D image plane.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.360
And these are referred to as the intrinsic parameters, and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.270
we'll again come up with the intrinsic parameter matrix.
