00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.250
Let's continue exploring this idea of using filters as

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.710
templates of what we want to find in two dimensions.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.470
Okay?

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.510
So a template is a thing that you give me and

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.180
you say I want you to find something else that looks like this and

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.830
we're going to do that through a filtering.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.990
And here's a nice example courtesy of Christian Grumman as well I believe.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.170
Although I'm not sure she made, if that's one these,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.930
by the way this is early in the class.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.670
You're going to see a lot of slides that have somebody's name next to them,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.270
because I've got them, the.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.760
And then what I later discovered is,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.270
many of these slides came from other people, and from other people.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.900
So the name that I put down is the name that I was able to track it towards.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.470
And the rest of us on the internet we're just making our way.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.150
All right.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.170
So, here's a very simple example.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.720
So here we have a scene on the left and we've got this template on the right.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.510
All right? So this is the think that we want to find.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.380
And you look over here and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.480
you say, oh I see where it is it's, it's, it's, it's right over here.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.810
So what we would like is our system to spit out something like this.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.830
Say aha, here's my little green box.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.900
Well what we can do is we can actually do this through a normalized correlation.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.390
If I take that masked kernel template and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.790
I do a normalized correlation with the image on the left, what I get is a map or

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.920
correlation image that looks like this.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.620
Okay?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.120
And you'll notice.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.450
That, where black lies over black and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.560
white lies over white, you can think of that as positive and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.730
negative, so I get some brightness over here and some brightness over here.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.030
But my really bright spot is right there

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.860
because that's the template having landed in the right place.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.350
So that's how you use correlation in order to do this detection because now

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.330
we're thinking of filters not so much as doing an averaging or

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.700
a blurring but actually being a template that we're looking for.
