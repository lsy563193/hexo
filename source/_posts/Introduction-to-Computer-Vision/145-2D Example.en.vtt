00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.741
So I can show you an example of this being done in 2D, that is,

00:00:03.741 --> 00:00:05.082
with an image, here.

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:05.963
Okay?

00:00:05.963 --> 00:00:08.034
Here we have a, an original image,

00:00:08.034 --> 00:00:11.701
a beautiful little still life of some fruit in black and white.

00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:16.636
And here is its Fourier transform power spectrum, just the magnitude, so

00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:18.841
I'm not showing you the phases.

00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:20.646
The middle, remember, we took,

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:23.521
we put the origin in the middle, is the low frequency.

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:27.560
And you can see that it falls off as you get out to the outside.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.309
Now, we're going to blur this thing with a Gaussian.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.966
And I'm showing you this Gaussian here at the same scale as the whole image.

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.570
So this Gaussian might be 15 by 15 pixels, but

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.548
it looks really small because we have a good sized image.

00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:44.789
But it's get, that would blur the image a little bit.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.718
And when I convolve the Gaussian with the original image,

00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:53.704
I get exactly what we'd expect, a slightly blurry version of the image.

00:00:53.704 --> 00:00:56.909
But look what happens in Fourier space.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.098
The Fourier transform of this tight little Gaussian is this big fat Gaussian.

00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:06.637
Remember, we said, small Gaussian in space has a big Gaussian in frequency.

00:01:06.637 --> 00:01:10.886
And then we multiply this times this.

00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:12.266
And what that's going to do is,

00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:15.147
it's going to keep the areas in the middle, which you see here.

00:01:15.147 --> 00:01:19.049
But it's going to attenuate the areas on the outside, so

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.498
it reduces those low frequencies.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:25.909
And in fact, if I had wanted to, in order to recover this image,

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.078
what I could have done was taken the Fourier transform here,

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:34.434
multiplied it by this one, gotten this, and recovered back.

00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:36.989
Except that to actually do the recovery,

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:40.274
it wouldn't be enough to just look at the magnitude.

00:01:40.274 --> 00:01:43.072
I would actually have to keep the real and imaginary parts.

00:01:43.072 --> 00:01:45.695
I'd have to keep the phase of the transform.

00:01:45.695 --> 00:01:48.773
But here, I just wanted to show you what happens to the different

00:01:48.773 --> 00:01:49.690
frequency power.
