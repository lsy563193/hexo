00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.090
So today what we're going to do is we're going to finish up Hough with two

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.060
significant changes.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.600
The first one is we're going to use non-analytic models.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.420
So it's not going to be lines, not going to be circles,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.210
where we had, where our parameters were analytic parameters.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.280
Instead, the parameters are going to express, say, the orientation or

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.410
the scale of some fixed but arbitrary template.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.570
The second thing, and this we'll only talk about briefly.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.450
Is a visual code word based approach where we

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.990
used what are called visual code words for

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.549
the features instead of edges, and this is much more modern computer vision.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.410
Edges really came from a, an older view of, of how objects would be described.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.880
And now the focus tends to be a lot more on individual features.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.510
And, later in the course, we'll talk about interest points, and features about

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.260
those points because I don't want to teach you just old computer vision.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.580
So, that was the, so the, the first one was then, and this is the now
