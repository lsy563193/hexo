00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.970
So, what we're going to do is we're going to calculate N.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.415
And it's actually really easy.

00:00:03.415 --> 00:00:04.750
You just step right through it.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.980
So we start off with s.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.895
S is going to be the number of points in the minimal set, okay?

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:13.000
P: the probability of success.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.700
This is, I wanted to have probability of p,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.150
that at least one of my samples will be a correct set of points.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.400
Now e, we said before, is the proportion of outliers.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.910
So, what's the proportion of inliers?

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.020
Well, if the proportion of outliers is 20%,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.470
the inliers is 80%, just 1 minus e, okay?

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.300
All right, now we start with just a little bit of combinatorics, all right?

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.170
So, let's suppose I pick s of these things.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.810
What's the probability that they're all inliers?

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.440
Well, if the pro, probability of in, being inlier is 1 minus e,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.950
the probability that they're, all s are inliers is 1 minus e to the s.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.560
I'm assuming that there are a lot of points to choose from.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.695
So, that the fact that I pulled one out doesn't diminish things.

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:01.790
It, it's a pretty good approximation.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.680
Okay, so that's the probability that all of

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.790
the points in the sample I pulled are inliers.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.580
So, what's the probability that at least one of those is an outlier?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.870
Well, 1 minus that.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.490
Okay, so that's just 1 minus 1 minus e to the s, okay?

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.030
So, if I pull out n sets, what's the probability that all n are outliers?

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.170
Well, given that my sets are independent, so

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.410
it's just this 1 minus, 1 minus e to the s, all raised to the n, okay?

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.380
So, that's the probability that all n samples have an outlier.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.960
Okay. But, of course,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.680
what we want is the probability that all of them are outliers.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.040
So that means they were all bad.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.000
We want that probability to be really small.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.370
That is, less than 1 minus the probability of, of the success.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.670
So judging here, right.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.370
So if p here was 99%, 1 minus p would be 1%.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.700
We want the probability that they were,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.949
all of our samples had at least one outlier in them.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.280
We want that to be less than 1%.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.100
So that means that we can now just substitute in.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.860
And we get this ugly expression,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.440
1 minus 1 minus e to the s to the N has to all be less than 1 minus p.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.000
Drum roll, please.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.480
We can solve for N and bingo.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.920
There is our equation.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.770
N's gotta be greater than the log of 1 minus p divided by the log of 1 minus

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.360
1 minus e to the s.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.420
And I'm sure you all have deep intuitions for what that looks like.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.710
No? Okay, let's look at some representative values.
