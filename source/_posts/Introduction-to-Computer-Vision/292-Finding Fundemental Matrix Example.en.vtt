00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.860
So let's work a simple example, all right, of finding the fundamental matrix.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.280
And bunch of them out there, one that I'm going to show here is

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.490
one that's a little bit different, because it's not as sort of trivial.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.530
Here's the one of the, the two side-by-side stereo views.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.010
We'll do them a little different.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.050
And remember, a fundamental matrix gives a corresponce between any two views.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.070
It doesn't matter where the cameras are taken, okay?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.940
So, for example, my images could look like this.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.860
And you might say whoa.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.890
Okay, you might not say whoa because that would be only if you

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.730
were born in the late 60s, or maybe early 60s.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.930
But here I have a picture and the white lines drawn on it are meant to

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.970
be sort of nominal epipolar lines, I took a picture and

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.090
then the camera moves forward, and then I take another picture.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.110
Can I do a fundamental matrix for that?

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.530
Of course I can.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.643
In fact that's what this geometry is meaning to show here, it's a,

00:00:55.643 --> 00:00:57.425
it's a little hard to see, all right.

00:00:57.425 --> 00:01:04.110
What I have here is that I took one picture and my camera center was there.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.920
And then I take another picture and my camera center is moved forward and

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.310
if you connect those and slice the image, those are the epipoles.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.010
So all the epipolar lines,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.820
have to go through the epipole and that's what this is showing you, right.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.950
The epipole is right in the middle of my picture.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.485
It's not exactly the middle, it's off to,

00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:29.020
to the top, it's actually to the side a little bit, I'll show you in a minute.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.930
But all the epipolar lines have to go through the epipole, and

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.660
that's another way of saying is.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.440
You know, just think about that intuitively, if I move straight ahead and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.780
I'm looking straight, the points move along that diagonal out from the center.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.850
So that means that if you give me one point in, in the first image,

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.060
it's going to be somewhere along that line in the second image.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.690
And how far it's along that line will be a function of its depth, okay?

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.750
Because remember, the amount that the points move, between one image and

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.080
the next, function of depth, going way back.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.730
Remember disparity, the closer something is, the more it'll be disparate.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.640
Something that's very far away like the moon doesn't change much at all.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.350
Okay?

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.470
So they're going to move along the epipolar lines.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.030
So we're going to use this as an example because it'll be very clear whether you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.710
got the epi polar lines right or you got the epi polar lines wrong
