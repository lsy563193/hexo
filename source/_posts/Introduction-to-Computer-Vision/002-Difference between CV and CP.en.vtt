00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.380
As some of you know, I also teach
the computational photography class.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.000
One question always comes up.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.230
What is the difference between these two
classes and the material covered in it?

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.960
There is indeed some overlap
between the classes,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.730
especially in the initial
few modules where we

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.259
learn about computing with images and
extracting information from images.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.040
Computational photography is really
about capturing a light from a scene

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.380
to record a scene into a photograph or

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.220
such other related novel artifact
that showcases the scene.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.520
Image analysis is done to
support the capture and

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.940
display of the scene in novel ways.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.760
Some of it's actually about
building newer forms of cameras and

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.769
softwares to facilitate that process.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.460
Computer vision is really about
interpreting an analysis of the scene.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.530
That is what is the content of the image
of the scene, who is in there,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.370
what is in the image and
what is happening.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.610
Needless to say, there is overlap and
one can benefit from the other.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.410
I also enjoy both of them and
I do work in research and education in

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.830
both these topics because they're about
building intelligence systems and

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.990
about actually processing and
analyzing images and photographs.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.020
I'm excited about it,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.060
I look forward to engaging with all of
you on either, or both, of these topics
