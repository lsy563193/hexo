00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.124
So that ends the lesson on stereo matching.

00:00:02.124 --> 00:00:04.783
In fact, that ends all of our lessons on stereo.

00:00:04.783 --> 00:00:08.071
You're going to implement the simple correspondence method.

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.018
By the way, for a more advanced version of this class, we ask to do the energy

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:16.178
minimization by either implementing or using the library for graph cuts.

00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:20.089
If you're so disposed, you might find that a really cool thing to do.

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.069
When you go to implement this simple version,

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.472
hopefully you're going to be impressed by two things.

00:00:24.472 --> 00:00:27.469
One is, doesn't work nearly, as well as I implied it work.

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:29.820
And I even, didn't even imply that it would work well at all, so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.788
that's really going to be.

00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:37.162
However, your computer will be seeing in 3D.

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:41.328
You're going to give it two pictures, we provide the pictures and

00:00:41.328 --> 00:00:43.884
your computer will recover the depth.

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:47.558
You know, up until not that long ago, that was considered magic done by

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:50.327
human being's brains that was un, not understood.

00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:53.310
And now you can do it on your iPhone, if you had two cameras.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.940
Anyway, I hope you'll find it cool that you can recover that depth.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.244
That ends for stereo.

00:00:58.244 --> 00:00:59.000
Talk to you soon.
