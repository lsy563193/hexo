00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.050
Let's talk about now a specific mathematical model of body reflection.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.570
Remember before we said it comes in,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.500
bounces around a little bit, and then scatters out.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.260
Okay? So, the model we're going to talk about is called Lambertian model, or a,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.660
it's a Lambertian BRDF, but

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.210
we'll just think of it as being a Lambertian, all right?

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.300
And we're only going to talk about the body reflection part.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.670
And Lambert's law, Lambert being the guy who did this.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.880
The sort of folksy way of thinking about it is, that no matter how I look at it,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.530
no matter what direction of reflectance that I have,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.620
it looks to be the same brightness.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.990
That is the only thing that's going to impact this, is the incidence component

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.690
of the light, not you know, the more perpendicular the surface is

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.670
to the light source, remember the radiance and air radiance thing, right?

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.870
It gets more of the light and therefore the brightness will only be

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.880
effected by the angle between the lig, the surface and the light source.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.620
Now, most people, not most people,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.970
some people will then show you a picture that looks like this.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.290
And by the way, if the person who made this picture is listening,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.200
I'm not saying that you didn't understand what happened.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.280
I'm just going to say that most people when they see this picture

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.470
think the following, which is not true.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.290
Okay?

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.560
What they think is that, you know,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.470
depending on the light source coming in, you know,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.240
the more, the more perpendicular it is, the more light you have reflecting out.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.560
That is true, but what's drawn here is that the amount of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.290
light coming out is the same in all directions.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.225
That is just not true.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:42.000
Okay?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.322
By the way, I want to thank Berthold Torn,

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:47.483
who by the way invented the shape from shading problems and

00:01:47.483 --> 00:01:51.032
most other computer vision problems way back in like the 70s and

00:01:51.032 --> 00:01:54.991
80s, because I took my first computer vision course and he made a big deal.

00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.200
And you see that Berthold, I was paying attention.
