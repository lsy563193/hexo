00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.670
Let's make use of that matrix, all right?

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.870
What does the essential matrix constraints say?

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.120
Essential matrix constraints says, that p prime times z times p equals 0.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.530
Where p prime and p are the locations of the points, one in the prime frame and

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.110
one in the regular frame.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.960
All right.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.720
So, where are our points P?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.610
Well, it's in some location, cap X, cap Y, cap Z.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.180
Okay.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.670
Which is also, in the other frame, cap X prime, cap Y prime.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.760
Also Z, because the Zs are the same because our planes are parallel, right?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.480
Right.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.480
So here are our points written.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.900
And the first time I wrote them as we said before,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.460
p is XYZ, P prime is X prime, Y prime, and the same Z.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.370
But, kind of written kind of cool over here, right?

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.020
We assume that under normal projection, little x is f times big X over big Z.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.010
So I'm just writing big X as Z times little x divided by f.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.960
Okay?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.090
And that's how I entered in these things here.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.290
Same thing with the primes over there.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.230
Okay?

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.778
Let's put those points in our, essential matrix equation.

00:01:20.778 --> 00:01:22.928
All right.

00:01:22.928 --> 00:01:25.850
So, I've just inserted them here using our e.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.040
And now I've done something a little bit sneaky again.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.570
So here I have p prime e p, but you'll notice I've now divided

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.650
my points all the way through by the, the amount z over f.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.370
A constant, right?

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.930
Z is whatever, s,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.440
something, I don't know what the value is, but it's some constant value, and f,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.150
I don't, might not know what that is, or I might, some value.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.500
And I just divided all the points through by that.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.750
Now, why am I allowed to do that?

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.900
See, in class, everybody yell out the answer.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.390
But over the ether.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.220
You guys can't say, because it equals 0, dummy.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.380
All right? So I can multiply anything I want by a constant and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.050
it stays equal to 0, and I just wrote it this way to make it

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.660
easier to see the equations that are about to happen.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.900
So I just divided by z over f.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.280
Copy that equation over again, multiply out the first one, so now we have x

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.880
prime, y prime, f dotted with, or transposed, of 0 bf, minus By equals 0.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.590
Multiply it more again, we get Bfy prime equals Bfy.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.600
B is a constant, f is a constant of divide through, and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.970
it just says y equals y prime.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.280
y equals y prime?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.370
What does that mean?

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.380
Oh.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.590
That means if I have some point in the image location x y in the regular frame,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.990
the line y prime equals y is the line, that this point has to be on.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.350
And think about what this is, so a,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.440
a points at x y so it's the sum x location and it's y, let's suppose y is 17.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.380
The equation y prime equals 17 is what.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.390
That's a horizontal line at height 17.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.040
So what this says is, our epipolar constraint for

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.420
parallel cameras, right, is that given a point in the image,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.210
the corresponding point is on the same horizontal line.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.220
Except last time, I just had to make you believe me.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.115
In fact, you didn't even ask the question, because it's very quiet in here,

00:03:24.115 --> 00:03:28.840
but, it made common sense that if these cameras were lined up it

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.120
should be at the same line.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.670
Well, common sense doesn't get you very far in mathematics.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.870
Here is the derivation, if you will, that from parallel planes you can

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.335
lined up this way, that your epipolar lines are horizontal.

00:03:42.335 --> 00:03:46.090
'Kay? So the answer to that previous quiz of, does this work for

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.060
parallel planes?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.950
It works beautifully, actually.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.680
The rotation matrix is just the identity and

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.930
it derives out that your epipolar lines are in this cast the horizon,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.030
the parallel horizontal lines at the same height.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.530
Cool huh?
