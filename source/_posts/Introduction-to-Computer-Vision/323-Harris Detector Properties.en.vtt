00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.790
What we're going to do is,

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.950
now we're going to look at some properties of the Harris detector.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.290
And actually of, of one or two other ways of detecting some interest points.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.180
Remember, the reason we're doing this is to find points that

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.890
are going to be our feature points.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.620
So, let's start with rotation, okay?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.010
If I've got an image.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.720
So we have here a little.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.800
Notional corner.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.570
And I would rotate it, how would the Harris operator change?

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.470
Well, remember that whole thing about the ellipse rotating?

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.040
Well the ellipse would rotate, right?

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.090
But it would be the same ellipse, right?

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.760
Because the variations in the gradients would be the same over the window.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.700
They just, the whole thing would have rotated.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.560
So basically, the Harris corner detector is invariant to rotation.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.010
That's cool. You don't have to take my word for it, you can take somebody elses

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.720
word for it, no, you can actually study these things empirically, alright.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.530
So the idea is you take some picture, you find some corners, and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.050
then you change the picture somehow, right.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.170
So, maybe you rotate it a little bit, and then you find some corners again, and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.550
you measure sort of this repeatability.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.920
Right? So the number of correspondences that were found versus

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.570
the possible ones that you should have found.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.340
That is, how repeatable was the ability to find the same corners?

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.360
And as you can see here, as they varied the rotation of the picture all the way

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.780
up to 180 degrees, you've got pretty good reviews.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.460
By the way, ImpHarrises improved Harris.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.420
But you can see that both Harris and the improved Harris are.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.080
Pretty invariant with respect to rotation.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.110
By the way, these plots come from this very nice paper from Cordelia Schmid and,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.970
and folks there.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.270
And in fact, here it is, showing you,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.110
it's from the International Journal of Computer Vision.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.260
I put this, these sort of basic res, sources in here just so

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.960
you can see where some of this stuff comes from.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.910
And if you're interested in computer vision,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.060
I encourage you to take a look at what these.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.090
Papers actually do, to get a sense of how this stuff got derived.
