00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.440
Let's go through this algebraically.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.070
So here we have our camera which has some viewing direction.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.990
All right, and the viewing direction's not going to matter because we're

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.100
going to assume a Lambertian system which is what we have here.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.770
We assume that it's just proportional to the cosine of the instant angle between

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.670
the light source and the normal, but the idea is that the camera is fixed.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.410
And for each one of our sources, source one we take our first image.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.410
Source two, we take our second image.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.710
Source three, we take our third image.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.645
Now notice, by the way, that rho is in these equations, right?

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:34.730
Rho is the albedo, so I'm not assuming I know the albedo.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.390
So now I have three images, right?

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.760
And I can write these as a matrix equation for, this is for

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.950
a single pixel, right?

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.140
So at a single pixel, I would have three different values and

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.920
I could just write this equation as rho.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.320
And these are the three vectors that are the source, directions and

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.440
by the way, I assume I know the source directions times the unit normal.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.960
And the unit normal is the thing that I don't know.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.390
So I need to solve for that, all right.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.120
So remember we're making this Lambertian assumption.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.760
So solving those equations is straightforward, its linear, simple system if we

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.360
have three lights, I is our three measurements three intensities.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.780
S are the three directions to the light source and

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.870
we know those so I and S are known.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.640
And then as we said before n is supposed to be uninormal, rho is the albedo.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.230
So together I call them n tilda.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.330
So to solve for n tilda is trivial.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.990
N tilda is just s inverse I, but of course n tilda is not unit normal.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.870
In fact it's magnitude is what?

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.110
It's magnitude is the albedo, so I can solve for rho, the albedo.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.300
And I can solve for

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.950
the unit normal as well, by justing taking the magnitude of that.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.860
Now of course, that's with three lights.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.920
And anything that works well with three lights,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.110
is going to work better with more lights.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.920
So let's suppose we have more lights, like M of them.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.990
Well, we get the same set of equations but now, we need a least square

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.770
solutions cause the system is over constrained and basically solve it here.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.950
So M by one is the number of measurements we have.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.940
And so, we have to take the pseudo inverse, and the pseudo inverse will give us

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.195
the least squares solution for n tilda, and then again you can find the albeido.
