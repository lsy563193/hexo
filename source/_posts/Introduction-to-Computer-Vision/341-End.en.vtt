00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.610
That ends this lesson on SIFT descriptors.

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:09.010
As I mentioned, getting SIFT to work can be painful, and that's why those of you

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.970
who are taking the OMS version of this and working on a problem set using it,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.251
we'll be giving you some libraries for computing the descriptors.

00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:20.030
You're going to be on your own, for finding the points, finding the interest

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.740
points, and figuring out maybe the scale or maybe we'll just fix the scale but

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.200
the idea is that then you can use the library to do the descriptor.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.620
Then, you're going to have to do all this matching.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.570
Okay?

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.860
Now, you know, matching, if you think about that, suppose you've got a thousand

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.450
descriptors here and a thousand descriptors there, right.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.440
That's a million combinations, if you're just trying to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.690
compare this one to every each point here to every point there.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.590
If you've got 10,000 that's 100 million, that might not

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.750
be really a very good idea, so you might want to do something smarter.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.400
And, what would it be to do smarter?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.610
What would be really smart would be to watch the next lesson, so

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.680
you can learn how to amaze your friends doing this.
