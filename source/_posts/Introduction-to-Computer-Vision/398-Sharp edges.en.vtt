00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.850
So as I said these operations are easy in 1D and a little trickier in 2D, and

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.290
of course it doesnt work at all if you have sharp shape variations.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.700
So here is a shape example I think also done by Ted Abelson.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.010
So here we have this sharp shape boundary right here, and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.730
the question is what is the relationship between these, this square and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.780
that square and actually you can take a look at these edges.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.010
Right? Well, you realize that these two are the same.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.210
And yet this square probably looks darker to you than that square.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.100
And in fact, here we go again.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.550
You can see that there's not boundary here, and there's no boundary there.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.010
These two squares are the same intensity,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.886
which by the way are the same intensity as that.

00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:50.605
All right?

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:57.080
So rednex would fail here because it would assume that this sharp boundary

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.470
was due to change in an object and not due to change in an illumination.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.190
because when you have a sharp shape change you have

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.890
a sharp illumination change and rednex doesn't deal with that at all.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.340
So what's going on here is refered to as sometimes as color constancy or

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.390
lightness constancy.
