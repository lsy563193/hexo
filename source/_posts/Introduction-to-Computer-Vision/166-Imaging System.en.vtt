00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.450
What is a camera or an imaging system?

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.480
So simple definition is,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.860
it's some device that allows the projection of light from three dimensions,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.220
three dimensional points, to some medium that will record the light pattern.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.560
That medium can be film or it can be a sensor, etc.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.320
But actually the key word to all of this is projection.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.260
So here's a projection.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.640
Some people walking on a sidewalk.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.070
And there's this globe like thing in the middle.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.950
And something that might convince you that something is a little strange might

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.830
be there's a tiny little guy standing on top of the world this was

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.680
a pre-clip for the movie Titanic.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.270
That was a joke.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.030
Tiny little guy.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.770
Leonardo DiCaprio's not so big.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.690
Okay anyway.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.240
What's really in that picture is that.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.960
Okay? And the reality is this picture wasn't actually the projection that

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.810
you thought it was.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.130
At least some of you.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.820
So you thought maybe it was like this ball thing that

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.810
you were looking at in an image.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.590
And no, actually,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.170
it was a flat thing that happened to be projecting into the camera.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.390
And that gives you an idea that when you do projection somehow you're

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.940
losing information, you're losing three dimensions,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.459
a third dimension you go from three to two.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.380
And we have to figure out what went on in that third dimension
