00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.540
When we do a Fourier transform, all we're doing is computing a basis set.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.740
And I'll show you what I mean by that.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.210
See this ugly, ugly integral here?

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.030
Ok, what I've got is, I've got the sine of one function, and

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.460
the sine of another.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.662
Two different frequencies, a and b.

00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:22.390
Okay and I'm integrating this all the way from minus infinite to plus infinite.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.890
And I claim here that it equals zero if a does not equal b.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.470
Now why is that true?

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.350
Any guesses?

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.619
Well let's just think about this intuitively all right?

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.790
If I have some sinusoid.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.820
And now I've gotta do one of a different frequency.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.465
That's easy.

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:41.580
[LAUGH] Boy, that's beautiful, huh?

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.240
Essentially, at some point when this is positive and

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.930
this is that same positive value, I'm going to try to find,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.140
hopefully there's some positive, I have to make one up.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.180
Yeah, let's pretend the red thing went down here like that a little bit, right?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.750
That when the, the red is same positive.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.080
The yellow was the negative of it.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.470
So the product of those two numbers and then some together is going to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.760
cancel each other out and that sort of a hand wavy way of saying that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.800
this entire integral is going to be zero as long as a does not equal b.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.980
But you might ask what happens when a does equal b?

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.000
&gt;&gt; What happens when a does equal b?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.630
&gt;&gt; Let's start with assuming they're in the same phase, exactly the same phase.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.630
Well, then it's just sine squared.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.880
Sine squared is positive.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.030
Sum that over infinity, what do you get?

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.720
You get infinity.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.320
So, if you have two sinusoids that are the same frequency,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.410
you'll get an infinite value.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.250
Unless they're perfectly pi over 2 out of phase,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.100
in which case it's going to be 0.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.930
In other words, sine times cosine keep going.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.400
But the bottom line is the way of thinking about this is that the,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.640
if I integrate a function, if it's made up of a sinusoid that's different than

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.310
omega, when I take the sine of omega and I do that full interval I get nothing.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.450
But if it's equal to that sine, I would get infinity.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.840
And that's going to be written like this.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.700
So let's just do a simple example.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.186
Suppose I've got a simple function: f of x as cosine of 2 Pi Omegax.

00:02:10.186 --> 00:02:11.412
All right?

00:02:11.412 --> 00:02:14.720
Well then, let's pick some frequency and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.850
we'll call it u here just keep things simple, right?

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.150
If I take this integral, okay, that's going to be infinite if u

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.950
is equal to that same omega, all right, and it's going to be zero otherwise.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.290
So that looks like this, okay?

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.530
So we just have these two member impulses.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.590
We just have these two infinite spikes here.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.470
And that's referred to as an impulse that corresponds to the cosine.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.900
You see that they're positive this way, and that's because it's cosine.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.900
If we have a sine, because sine of negative x is negative sine of x,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.930
that would look like it would be up here and that would be down there.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.050
That's what the sine is, okay?

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.630
That's, and that's kept us the imaginary part.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.280
So we're just computing a basis set of saying how much of this,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.370
sinusoid is in there, all right?

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.370
And we can do that for all frequencies.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.310
But then you might ask, well don't we also have to do it for all phases?

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.610
&gt;&gt; Don't we also have to do it for all phases?

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.130
&gt;&gt; She studied that one.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.250
Well, the short answer is no.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.960
One of the cool things is if I have cosine of omega x and

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.850
sine of omega x, right?

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.540
So one is 90 degrees or power of two phase out of phase.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.950
I can make any phase by a linear combination of those.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.370
You can show that, it's just true, we can do a little demo.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.500
But basically, if I have a sinusoid of any phase, if you just tell me sort of

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.570
what its integral is with respect to cosine and what its integral is

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.020
with respect to sine, I can tell you what the phase of that sinusoid is.
