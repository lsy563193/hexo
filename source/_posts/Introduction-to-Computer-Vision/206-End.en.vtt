00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.800
That ends the lesson on epipolar geometry.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.470
In the next lesson,

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.860
what we're going to assume is that we know the epipolar lines.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.430
In fact, most of what we'll talk about we'll use horizontal, parallel,

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.130
lined up epipolar lines.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.450
And then we'll go about solving the correspondence problem.
