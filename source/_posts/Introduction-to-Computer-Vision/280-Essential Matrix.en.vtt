00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.000
Back to where we were.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.816
Remember this equation, 0 is equal to X'.(T x RX)?

00:00:04.816 --> 00:00:07.320
We just rewrote that again.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.550
So, now I can get rid of that whole cross product thing, right, and put that

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.350
cool, little funky cross product notation in there, right, right, all right?

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.940
So, let me do a substitution.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.440
I'm going to let E.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.680
Be just this, T cross R, okay, so it's just this substitution in here.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.410
Well, as soon as you do that, you realize, I have this really beautiful elegant

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.920
expression that says X' prime transpose EX equals 0.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.590
And E is what's called the essential matrix.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.500
And what's cool about the essential matrix is that, it relates the point X and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.820
the same point, but it described in the other camera frame.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.630
And note that these are world points.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.500
In these frames for these calibrated systems.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.800
In a little bit we'll talk about the relationship between, world points and

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.410
the image points.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.880
And it's a little bit closer than you might think,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.050
because of the projective geometry.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.760
In fact, one way of thinking about this really easily is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.620
this is equal to 0, right?

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.850
So what if I multiplied X by some value A?

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.470
Would the equation still be true?

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.970
Of course it would.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.610
So not only is it true for

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.480
the point out here, as expressed in this coordinate frame, it's true for

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.720
every point along that ray, expressed in that coordinate frame.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.800
Likewise for every point along that ray.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.220
Expressed in that coordinate frame, ooh.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.270
That means, it also talks about image points, but we'll get there, all right?

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.020
One last thing, and this is going to, you're not going to totally get

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.440
that this time, but that's okay, you're going to get it next time, all right?

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.010
We said that this works for sort of, any point along that ray.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.170
And, so you can think of that as the homogenous representation of all

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.140
the points along that array.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.196
So this, so our E is our 3 by 3 here, times this 3 by 1, so

00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:06.320
this is another vector here.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.660
All right, we'll just call that L, okay.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.300
Why am I calling it L?

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.180
What does L stand for?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.230
Well in some weird language, we said it stood for

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.940
point, but in our language, it stands for line.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.170
So remember that X transpose L, or P transpose L,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.690
or L transpose P was the definition of a line in projective geometry.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.770
So what this means is, if I knew where some point was in the image.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.020
So I know what ray it's along in the image.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.330
So I know where it is in the image.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.400
I could put that point into this equation.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.240
And I would have this L, which defines for me a line, in the other frame.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.310
Just X prime transpose L equals 0,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.230
that was the, the definition of a line in our projective geometry.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.980
So in other words, if I gave you a point in one image of a calibrated set of

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.010
cameras, there's a line in the other image that that point must lie on.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.440
What's that line called?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.560
That's the epipolar line.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.900
But notice, that everything on this side of the slide is algebra, right?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.760
Forget all the geometry stuff.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.680
So what we've done is we've now converted the epipolar constraint into

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.850
an algebraic expression.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.870
Thank you very much.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.690
No. That's what we're going to use, okay?

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.190
Great.
