00:00:00.335 --> 00:00:03.210
Okay, so now I've got these two
equations, I can combine them.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.500
The first one is obvious.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.590
This is the original
brightness constancy equation.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.700
The second one after
I substitute in the,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.920
the Taylor series expansion, there's
a little slight of hand going on.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.770
What I'm doing is,
I'm substituting for this value.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.697
Remember it says that I can get
the location at x plus u, y plus v,

00:00:23.697 --> 00:00:24.650
all right?

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.110
I can do the Taylor expansion, so
here's the original x, y at t plus 1.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.790
And then there is this derivative part
okay, I of x times u, I sub y times v.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.623
And I of x is the derivative
in the x direction

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:42.125
I of v is the derivative
in the y direction.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.920
Now, students will usually ask me,
wait a minute,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.000
is that a time t or a t plus 1?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.917
&gt;&gt; Is that a time t or a t plus 1?

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:52.280
&gt;&gt; The short answer?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.140
Doesn't matter.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.620
The idea is we're going to assume that
things are changing so slowly and so

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.710
gently that the derivative
at a particular point

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.865
is going to be the same whether
I look at t or t plus 1.

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:10.930
It's a little bit shall we say, dicey?

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.190
But actually, in the limit, it's true.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.380
And we, we only care in
some sense about the limit.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.070
So, taking those two equations,
I've now rearranged things.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.410
I just moved this part over to here.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.640
And then in the next line,
what I did was, this is I sub t.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.234
I sub t is this difference there,
between I of x, y,

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:36.980
t plus 1, minus I of x, y, t.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.208
Well, what is I sub t?

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:41.950
Well, if I of x is the derivative
of I in the x direction,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.374
and I sub y is the derivative
of I in the y direction,

00:01:45.374 --> 00:01:49.130
I sub t is the derivative
of I in the time direction.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.180
It's what's called
the temporal derivative.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.220
And remember, our imagery is
now a function of x, y and t.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.410
So, I can take a derivative in x,
in y, or in t.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.280
Another way to think about is, if I just
look at some point x, y and I see how

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.520
much the, the image changes from t to t
plus 1, that's my temporal derivative.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.200
And then, finally, on this last one,
you'll see that this here

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.240
is just Ix times u plus Iy times v.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.262
That's just the gradient, Ix,
Iy, dotted with however the,

00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:25.640
the, the point is moving, that's u, v.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.290
So, we write that like this,
that 0 is approximately It

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.456
plus the gradient of the image,
dotted with this vector u, v.

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:36.670
U,v is the direction of motion.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.292
Got it?

00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:40.492
Cool, all right, keep going, now,

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:45.292
this is approximation in
the limit as u and v approach 0.

00:02:45.292 --> 00:02:48.670
Now you might,
ask how can u and v approach 0?

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.553
Well, the idea is that that in the
limit, of course, if t was very small,

00:02:52.553 --> 00:02:55.309
the amount of motion you'd
get would be very small,

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.208
you would just have the direction.

00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:00.414
So we're going to assume
that they're very small and

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:03.950
we're just going to take this
equation directly as is.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.560
That, 0 is equal to It,
plus this, this gradient.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.785
And that, written out either above as
a gradient or here in algebraic form,

00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:18.335
that's the brightness
constancy constraint equation.

00:03:18.335 --> 00:03:19.735
Say that five times fast.

00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:22.625
Brightness constancy
constraint equation.

00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:25.595
All right.
Ixu plus Iyv plus It equals 0
