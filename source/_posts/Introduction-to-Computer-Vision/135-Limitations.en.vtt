00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.325
Let's just talk about a couple limit limitations on this,

00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:07.240
which are going to get us to the Fourier series in just a minute, okay?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.850
For this integral to exist,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.377
this Fourier transform, we don't actually want infinites, right?

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:15.250
Because that's not so good when, when are, when we, when we try to like,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.840
write down infinity, it just goes a really long time, all right.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.060
One thing we'd say is that this whole thing is integrable,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.580
okay, if the original function itself is integrable.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.350
That is if I take the, the function, I actually have to take its absolute value.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.970
If I sum it up from minus infinity to infinity, it, it can't explode.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.040
It has to be limited to a value.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.340
So you might ask, but wait a minute, I thought we had infinite repeating series.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.600
&gt;&gt; I thought we had infinite repeating series.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.870
We did when we were talking about Fourier series.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.720
We're now talking about the Fourier transform,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.000
where we're trying to keep things bounded.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.200
So the idea is that these integrals have to exist.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.980
It's base, it's based on the same principle, but it's, it's this idea.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.135
So in Fourier series, we talked about repeating functions.

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:03.400
In Fourier transform we're talking about integral,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.890
integrable functions, all right?

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.570
In a minute when we have a fixed length function, it'll be clear.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.370
In fact, let's get to that right now.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.260
You see it says, so obviously if there was a bound of width T.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.560
Right, so if, if all my entire function fell within T, then obviously I could

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.590
just integrate from sort of, T, negative T over 2, to plus T over 2, right?

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.150
That would be the entire integral.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.120
And that's going to lead us,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.530
at least in my twisted mind, to this notion of the discrete Fourier transform.
