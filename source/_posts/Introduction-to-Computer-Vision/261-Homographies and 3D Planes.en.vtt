00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.600
There are two more things I want to show you.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.200
One is just some nice little mathematics to explain to you

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.150
about homographies and planes, and the second is some of

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.630
the cool things we can do with homographies and planes besides just, mosaics.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.379
So, let me show you a simple proof, if you will, or a demonstration,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.060
about this eight degrees of freedom being a mapping between any planes.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.360
So, let's go back to our calibration from the external world to the internal.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.540
So you remember this?

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.050
Right, X, Y, Z, 1 is mapped through a 3 by 4 homogeneous matrix.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.320
Or I should say it's a matrix we're doing this homogeneously.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.430
To get out the projective similar UV 1 over there.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.180
And remember we talked about solving for

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.290
all the 12 M's using lots of extrinsic points.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.420
But suppose.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.120
Just suppose, all the points in the world were lying on a plane.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.610
So you might remember from your algebra that simple equation of plane.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.950
aX plus bY plus cZ equals d.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.650
Right? So that's the equation of a plane.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.650
Basically what it says is it, it gives me the normal to the plane and

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.290
where along the, that normal the plane has to be.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.510
What this equation means is that I could solve for Z in terms of X and

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.170
Y and a, b, c and d, and I could plug that in.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.910
And that's what we did here.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.110
Here we removed Z, and put in its equivalent expression in terms of X, Y and

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.890
the a, b, c and d which define the plane.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.870
And so, now, it's the same end matrix that we had before.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.740
But we've gotten rid of the Z.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.150
But wait.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.240
If I have only X, Y and a constant in this term for

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.000
Z, I can put all the influence of this column, 02, 12,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.630
and 22 of m, I can put that in these other.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.900
Coefficients.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.770
Right? I don't actually need this column, since that's just multiplying

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.470
the terms that have the XYs and the constants in them.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.890
I can put all the effect into those other three columns.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.890
So when I do that, it looks like this.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.310
Okay? And you'll notice I now have a column of zeroes here.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.570
Okay, so that's really not doing very much.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.050
I just have these three columns multiplying X, Y, and 1.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.870
All right?

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.490
But, that's just a 3 by 3.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.610
That's my homography.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.350
Okay?

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.210
That's why the mapping.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.630
&gt;From any plane to any plane can be done by a 3 by 3 from

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.190
a location on 1 plane to a location on the image plane?

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.680
And so basically between any planes.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.320
In fact a way of thinking about that is this, right?

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.980
Mapping between planes is a homography.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.230
You give me four points on this plane and four points on that plane,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.190
I now know how all the other points on the plane map to each other.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.480
And whether it's between a plane in the world and an image plane, or

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.560
just thinking about it between arbitrary planes, that's the warping that

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.480
it takes in order to do this homography or projected projection warp.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.960
Between the planes.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.460
And mapping between planes is something we do a lot in Computer Vision.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.020
Which is why these homographies show up quite a bit.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.880
We're going to do even more sort of sophisticated way of thinking about

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.930
lines and planes in the next lecture.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.718
Where we do even more about projective geometry.

00:03:13.718 --> 00:03:15.059
Got it?

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:16.119
Cool.
