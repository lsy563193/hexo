00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.030
So now that we have the Fundamental matrix, well, so what?

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.050
Well as we said, it relates between the pixel coordinates in the two views.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.840
And it's much more general then the in, then the essential matrix,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.410
because we've removed the need to know the intrinsic parameters.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.250
If you told me the intrinsics, okay,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.530
then I could figure out the rays that correspond.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.070
And if I know the rays that correspond in,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.930
in the, the 3D camera coordinates, I can compute the essential matrix.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.660
I could figure out the real rotation of translation.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.130
But if I have two arbitrary cameras that aren't even necessarily the same,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.970
the fundamental matrix allows me to relate them without worrying about

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.230
the intrinsics or the extrinsics.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.890
So the bottom line is if we estimate the fundamental matrix from

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.000
the correspondences, then we can reconstruct our epipolar geometry without

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.810
having to worry at all about the intrinsics or extrinsics of the camera.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.900
And that's what's done here.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.230
Here you see two pictures.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.390
I think this is also courtesy of stealing from Andrew's instrument.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.400
And you have some pixels on the left and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.600
some pixels on the right and then they were put into correspondence.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.430
The idea is I gave you corresponding points, and now the lines that

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.980
are drawn on here, those are the corresponding epipolar lines.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.310
So, in fact if you take a look real quick.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.310
So you'll notice that, you know, here's a point right on the bottom edge of

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.790
that window, and this line lands right on the bottom edge of that window.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.780
So these are corresponding epipolar lines.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.990
Any point that's along this line, is also going to be along that line.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.520
Let's see, does that really work.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.352
Let's see, it goes across this chimney thing, yep there it is right there.

00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:33.553
Okay, so that's finding the epipolar lines by

00:01:33.553 --> 00:01:38.450
giving the correspondences through solving for the fundamental matrix.
