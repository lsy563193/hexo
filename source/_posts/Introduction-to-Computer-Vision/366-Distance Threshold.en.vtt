00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.944
&gt;&gt; The bottom line is in order for you to pick a threshold if you wanted to do

00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:08.809
this sort of analytically, what you need is a noise model.

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.885
And unfortunately, this noise model is not the same model as the thing we

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:12.749
were going before.

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.316
It's not our line, it's our dist, it's our belief.

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:19.820
I'll use the word belief, maybe, instead of model of no, because it's model.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.757
It's a model of how that the, the noise behaves.

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:25.760
So let's go back to our line example, you remember this?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.566
So if we were just looking at a line so let's assume that we,

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.680
you know, we have this real line and

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.703
that our points are perturbed by a Gaussian by Gaussian noise.

00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:38.406
This is the thing we looked at last time.

00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:43.144
So the distance in a Gaussian is sometimes a complicated thing.

00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:47.051
So you've got multi-dimensional Gaussian, you may know about Chi squared and

00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:50.751
that the, and the square root of that is the distribution of, of the distances.

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:54.056
In one d, it's actually much easier.

00:00:54.056 --> 00:00:57.185
It's essentially what's called a half normal.

00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:02.342
Because basically, you know, the probability that you're d, o, a is, it's,

00:01:02.342 --> 00:01:06.933
you could either be d this way or d that way, but d is only a positive value.

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.937
So it's just twice the regular Gaussian distribution.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:13.074
That's what this dis distribution here looks like.

00:01:13.074 --> 00:01:15.142
Because it says, d greater than zero.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:19.109
But all that matters is given a noise model,

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.550
you could generate a distance model.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.853
And given a distance model, you could pick a threshold.

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:29.764
So in fact, if you have this 1D Gaussian, let's say and

00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:34.819
let's suppose it has a distribution of, of parameter of sigma squared,

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:38.833
then you could set the threshold t, based upon t squared.

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:41.969
Is this number 3.84 sigma squared?

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.405
Where the heck does 3.84 come from?

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:49.484
Well, I just arbitrarily said, let's pick a threshold such that

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:54.014
95% of the inliers would fall within that threshold.

00:01:54.014 --> 00:02:00.654
So 95%, if you got sigma squared then I said, t squared at 3.84 sigma squared.

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:05.160
If you wanted 99%, you'd have to make it bigger threshold.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.728
If you're willing to remove some points, you'd make it a smaller one.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.830
But the idea is that you have some threshold.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.603
And then you're going to accept the point if the distance D

00:02:12.603 --> 00:02:16.037
is less than that threshold, you'll count that point as an inlier.

00:02:16.037 --> 00:02:16.604
Okay?

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:17.839
Cool. All right.

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.540
So let's see, we've got our number of points.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.344
We have our distance threshold t, it says what we did here before.

00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:25.746
We've go one more.

00:02:25.746 --> 00:02:28.215
The number of samples we're going to compute.

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:31.919
Now this is not s, the number of points within a sample.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.990
Right? A sample is a set of points that it takes to compute a model.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.593
This is how many times are we going to draw a sample.

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:43.430
How many models are we going to try and check.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.104
So what we'd like to do is we'd like to choose N to be big enough.

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:55.409
That we can't actually guarantee that we're always going to get inliers, can we?

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.344
Right?

00:02:56.344 --> 00:02:59.251
Because if we're randomly picking points, et cetera and

00:02:59.251 --> 00:03:02.349
unless we were to exhaustively pick all, say, N choose two.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.198
If we're just randomly picking things, it's only with probability that we

00:03:06.198 --> 00:03:09.523
can say that, what's the likelihood that we got a good solution?

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:14.073
So what's we're going to do is let's pick a probability p and

00:03:14.073 --> 00:03:17.484
what we want to know is how big does N have to be,

00:03:17.484 --> 00:03:22.403
such that the probability is p, let's say, 0.99, 99%.

00:03:22.403 --> 00:03:26.099
That at least one of our samples will just be made up of

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.044
points that come from the correct model?

00:03:29.044 --> 00:03:29.677
Right?

00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:31.363
So, that's a way of saying if,

00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:35.115
if this line, I actually get two points that really came from the line.

00:03:35.115 --> 00:03:37.383
Or another way of saying it is, I've got this,

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:41.155
all these putative matches that are compute and I want to compute a homography.

00:03:41.155 --> 00:03:44.703
I want at least one set of four matches that I

00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:48.462
test to actually be the correct homography.

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:49.430
All right.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.966
So the question there is can we figure that out?

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.802
And in particular, it should be pretty clear.

00:03:54.802 --> 00:03:57.338
What if all the points were right?

00:03:57.338 --> 00:04:00.241
That is all the matches were right.

00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:03.041
Well, then as soon as you pick some set of four, you would have four

00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:05.746
points that's correct and you would get the right homography.

00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:08.716
What if none of the point matches were correct?

00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:10.800
Well, then you could be there all day and

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.954
you're never going to get four that match.

00:04:12.954 --> 00:04:17.791
In between those is that there's some percentage of points that are not correct.

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:19.844
So if the ones that are correct are called inliers,

00:04:19.844 --> 00:04:22.196
what do you thing the ones that are not correct are called?

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:23.365
&gt;&gt; Outliers.

00:04:23.365 --> 00:04:24.732
&gt;&gt; Outliers.

00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:30.197
So the question is for a given percentage of bad points, for

00:04:30.197 --> 00:04:32.506
a given outlier ratio E.

00:04:32.506 --> 00:04:34.808
So let's, E is 20, is 20%.

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:37.445
Means that 20% of your points are bad.

00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:41.050
For a given ratio, how many samples do we have to check?
