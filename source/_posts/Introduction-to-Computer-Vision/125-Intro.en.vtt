00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.590
All right, welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.410
So let's see, so we did the images as functions for a little bit, and

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.330
started talking about edges.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.170
And then we took a little bit of a detour where we talked about Hough

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.710
transform in terms of extracting information using those images as evidence.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.910
So now it's time to get back just a little bit to image processing.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.220
And this lesson, and one more, or maybe two more beyond this.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.340
We're going to be talking about what's called frequency analysis.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.160
Now in the old days, that is, and that's actually pretty old already.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.050
Now we're talking 40 years ago, 30, 40 years ago.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.740
All of you who would be working on images,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.630
you would have actually been electrical engineers, and

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.810
you would have spent a lot of your time studying this stuff that we're

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.100
going to be talking about extensively.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.220
You define your filters and other types of image analysis operation in terms of

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.580
what's called frequency response.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.980
That is, how things change when you have high frequency stuff, and

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.640
then low frequency stuff.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.340
But most of you are much more oriented to computer science,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.840
where we tend to think of images as data structures and not so much as a signal.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.840
But some of this understanding is still critical.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.950
This is especially true for a phenomena referred to as aliasing.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.640
I know many of you are familiar with aliasing in a sort of image perspective

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.770
where you see the little jaggies, because you've got a line that doesn't go

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.370
perfectly straight, but it's actually a frequency phenomenon, and in fact,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.990
the goal of this lesson and the next few, is to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.360
get to a point where you can talk about aliasing from a frequency perspective.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.890
And, it'll teach you why, if, for example, if you have an image and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.860
you want to make it half the size, you shouldn't just throw out every row,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.670
every other row, and every other column.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.620
That's the wrong thing to do.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.180
And, by the time we're done with this,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.220
you'll, you'll see sort of why that's the case.
