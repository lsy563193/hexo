00:00:00.171 --> 00:00:03.943
The problem with everything that I just showed you,

00:00:03.943 --> 00:00:07.554
is it would be very difficult to turn it into code.

00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:08.820
Why do I mean that?

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.710
What I mean is, I've been showing you everything in terms of geometry, right?

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.380
I'm like waving my hands, and we've got points, etcetera, whatever.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.230
Computers don't do so

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.820
well with, waving hands and, despite what my undergraduates say.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.200
Okay?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.980
What we need to do is we need to go from the geometry, to algebra.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.640
Because believe it or

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.440
not, computers are fine for algebra as long as you know what you're doing.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.540
That is, you can convert, algebraic expressions into computations.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.240
In fact, we talked about that earlier.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.390
But, it's very hard to go from geometry to computation.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.440
And the way we're going to do that,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.600
is we're going to take the geometry and then convert that to algebra.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.620
So we're going to start off, today with a pair of calibrated cameras.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.890
Okay, so here's my pair of calibrated cameras.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.590
I have two camera centers, Oc, and Oc prime,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.100
and they're both looking at some world point, X.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.530
And it's viewed in the two images, and it's seen here.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.190
Because these are calibrated cameras,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.600
I'm going to assume that I know the translation T, along the baseline.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.200
It. Sorry T is the vector that is the baseline right so,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.960
if I have to shift you know, two, seven, nine.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.230
To get from one camera to the other in XYZ, that's what my translation would be.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.930
And I also know R, I know the rotation matrix though, you would have to

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.920
rotate one camera center to become aligned with the other camera center.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.220
That's what it means to be calibrated.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.360
So we write this, this way, okay?

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.860
It says from geometry to algebra, we're not quite there but, but

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.910
we're almost there.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.670
But basically what we're saying is,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.050
the location of the point X in the prime frame, can be expressed by

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.740
rotating X as appearing in the non prime frame and then translating it by T.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.470
That's just the equations we had before.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.990
I know this is not the homogenous version, it's okay,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.180
in a minute we'll make everything beautiful.
