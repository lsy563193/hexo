00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.120
So those are our discreet gradients, but now we said we wanted an operator.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.460
Right, we want to mask our kernel that can implement these gradients.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.920
So here's an example of an operator H.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.720
And I'm going to use three rows, and I'll tell you why in just a minute.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.860
For now we only have these two columns.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.270
So the question is, is this a good operator?

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.070
&gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No, it's not a good operator.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.030
Why is it not a good operator?

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.520
Well there's a couple reasons.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.890
One of which is there is no middle pixel.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.049
So it's hard for me to say that this pixels value because the question is

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.860
what's special about the right.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.060
It's should be, I could also be able to go to the left.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.580
So, if I wanted to do that what might I do?

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.440
Well, I might do an operation that looks like that.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm going to go to the right here, and the left there.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.960
Now, you might ask yourself why is it a plus a half and minus a half.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.500
&gt;&gt; Why is it?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.320
&gt;&gt; No, ask yourself, don't ask me.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.020
Well, okay, here's why.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.920
It's the average of the right derivative and the left derivative.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.770
And what I mean by that is, the right derivative would be a plus one here, and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.710
a minus one there, okay.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.120
The left derivative would be a plus one here, and a minus one there.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.550
If I wanted to average them, I would add them and divide by two.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.460
So, I add them I get minus 1, 0, 1, and then when I divide by 2.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.990
I get minus one-half and plus one-half, with a 0 in the middle.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.690
So that's why this thing that goes plus a half to the right minus a half to

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.190
the left is the average of the left and right derivatives.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.940
Get it?

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.440
Cool.
