00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.480
So, you might say, woah, didn't we already do this?

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.720
We did the ideal perspective projection, where we said that some value

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.200
u was just going to be the focal length times x divided by z, and v was,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.030
was y divided by z multiplied by f, as well.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.010
So you might ask, aren't we done?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.080
Well, no, because that would be in some idealized world.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.360
The first problem going back to here is, f might be in, you know,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.720
millimeters, so we might have a ten millimeter lens, or a 50 millimeter lens,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.950
but the pixels, the screen pixels, they're in some arbitrary coordinate, right?

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.790
That depends upon exactly how many pixels we get per millimeter in the sensor.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.740
So the first thing that happens is that we introduce an alpha that's just

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.180
going to scale that value, because we don't really know what f is.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.330
Now sometimes people will give you an f,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.530
a focal length, in pixels, which is kind of a weird thing.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.830
But what they're actually doing is,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.000
they're giving you this combined value that is sort of the conversion from

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.700
millimeters to pixels times millimeters, just given to you, and pixels.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.730
But basically, because they may be in some arbitrary units,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.170
we have a scale factor alpha.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.380
So that's one degree of freedom.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.850
But, who said the pixels are square?

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.250
Megan, did you say pixels are square?

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.940
No.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.081
Now, it turns out pixels are more square now than they used to be.

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:22.700
They used to be cool and now they're, nah, never mind.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.836
Anyway, pixels are more square now than they used to be.

00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:27.050
The used to be, back in television, more of television days,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.610
pixels had the same aspect ratio as actually a television.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.310
So a pixel was wider than it was tall, and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.450
some other things, they were taller than they were wide.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.140
They weren't necessarily fixed.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.600
In fact, even some CCD arrays that I calibrated once,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.900
it turned out that well, it was almost square.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.910
It was like 95% of the height was equal to the width, all right?

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.850
So because they're not exactly square, you might have a separate scaling factor

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.130
between the u direction and the v direction.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.710
And so now we've introduced beta.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.960
So now we have two degrees of freedom.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.670
But we're not done.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.515
Next, well you remember we put the center of projection,

00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:08.250
when we were doing the ideal projection.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.020
We put the center projection right at the camera coordinates system.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.140
As if the image was taken so that zero, zero was right in the middle.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.610
But of course, we don't have any guarantee of this, right?

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.430
The image may have been cropped out of a a section of the window.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.140
Or the, the location of the image actual sensor might need,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.490
might not be lined up with the optical axis of the camera.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.070
So we have two offsets, a u and a v offset, u0, v0.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.820
So now we're up to one, two, three, four degrees of freedom.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.180
Two scale factors and two offsets.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.210
Are we done yet?

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.070
But wait, there's more.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.570
Here comes the really ugly one.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.450
We're assuming that the u direction and

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.340
the v direction are actually perpendicular.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.070
What if there's actually a little bit of a skew?

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.200
So u and v went out drinking one night, and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.000
they came back just off a little bit, all right?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.190
So that's what's shown in this figure here.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.590
The idea is that the ideal u and v are this way, okay?

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.890
But maybe the sensors actually sampled that way and that way.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.010
That is, that the, the actual sampling of u,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.800
v is not perpen, are not perpendicular, and they're off by some angle theta.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.850
So that's what these equations are showing you here.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.230
They're showing you the relationship between the v-prime which is measured and

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.740
the actual v, the u-prime and the actual u.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.420
And so, when you substitute those into those equations we just had,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.800
you get this sort of ugliness, okay?

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.150
So this is the really ugly extrins, sorry, intrinsic parameter representation.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.030
And now we have, how many?

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.990
Well we've got an alpha and a beta, the two scale factors.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.300
That's two degrees of freedom.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.710
A u0 and v0 for the two offsets.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.450
Plus theta, which is the skew
