00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.860
So to get some insight into this question, I want to show you some very

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.380
very greatly reduced images which are still going to be meaningful, that is,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.470
you know, what is going on to me in use, so normally when I do this in class,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.470
what I do is I say raise your hand when you can tell me, if you can tell me,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.510
what’s in the picture.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.000
So I would show then this.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.270
And everybody would raise their hand, and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.610
they would say it’s some goofy looking lion.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.490
All right?

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.910
And I would show them a picture like this, okay, there, there’s an elephant.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.880
There’s a really cool, old car.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.440
There is a, something I'm never going to own, a private jet.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.830
But what you can see about these pictures is there's actually not a lot of

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.140
pixels being used in this, in these pictures of different grayscale values.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.830
Instead, somebody has just sort of drawn in the edges.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.550
And yet, that conveys to you a lot of the information.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.900
So the idea is that, in some sense, edges in an image seem to be important,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.170
they seem to convey something about what's going on.
