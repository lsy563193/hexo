00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.870
Hello, welcome back to computer vision.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.070
Today, we're going to start talking about, stereo and

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.550
this particular lecture is on stereo geometry.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.260
In general, the next few lectures are going to be on

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.760
the relationship between sort of camera geometry and scene geometry.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.510
We're starting with stereo because frankly you guys are going to do this,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.480
in a problem set and I want to be able to get you there quickly, and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.280
also in some sense it is the conceptually easiest way to get started.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.280
So stereo is really just a special case of having multiple views of an image,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.630
two particular views, and here's just an example of two views of a vase.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.900
In fact, we're going to get to this particular figure, oh,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.110
a little bit later when we talk about epipolar geometry.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.000
But the idea is that there's this relationship between two views, and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.940
you can use it to recover the depth that's there.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.720
We'll also take a look at sort of having arbitrary different views, and this is

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.440
an image that comes from work on using special features to align objects and

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.290
be able to detect that they're there, but, again,

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.270
you have two different views and you have to figure out how they relate.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.960
This is an example of what you can get from stereos, so

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.720
the picture on the left is one half of a stereo pair,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.540
on the right is a crude depth map, the brighter things are, the closer they are,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.310
in fact, we're going to talk about how to compute exactly that.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.770
And in general, you can have lots of views,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.250
where you have images taken from a whole bunch of places, or

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.610
a whole bunch of directions, and it's a question of how do these images relate.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.360
And this notion of how images relate and

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.210
how do they relate to the scene, that's what we're going to be focusing on.
