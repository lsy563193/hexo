00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.460
Well, you can e, easily think about it this way.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.650
Let's define a rigid body as just a collection of points whose

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.880
relative positions to each other can't change.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.510
And, for the mathematicians in the audience,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.400
we're going to pretend that's a well-defined statement, okay?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.380
Or, you can think of it as a box.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.120
So, the first thing I can do is I can located that box in 3D.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.990
I can take one point of that box,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.330
say the corner here, and figure out the x, y and z location of that box.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.080
So, that's three degrees of freedom.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.820
Then, I can take some other point on that box,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.310
let's say the corner, and I can move it around.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.800
Now, I can't change it's location space arbitrarily because I'm

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.970
holding this point fixed.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.740
So, essentially, this corner can move around on the sphere.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.130
So, this point here can be moved around anywhere on the sphere.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.850
So rot, this is supposed to be like rotated backwards this way, all right?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.950
And just the way you can think of on a globe.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.460
&gt;From the middle, there's a latitude and longitude to get any location.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.100
There's two degrees of freedom of a vector's direction.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920
So, that's another two degrees of freedom.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.920
So, we're up to five.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.900
And finally, once I have this vector specified, I can rotate,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.980
I can spin about that vector.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.150
So, the cube here, as indicated by this fancy Microsoft PowerPoint arrow that's

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.950
in here, we can rotate it about that diagonal.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.830
So, that's one more degree of freedom.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.850
So, that's why there are six degrees of freedom for a rigid body.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.680
I'm going to assume most of you knew that already, but there you go.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.040
That's why there's a fast forward button.
