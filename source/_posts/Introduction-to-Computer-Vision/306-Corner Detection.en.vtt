00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.065
All right.

00:00:01.065 --> 00:00:05.840
So, fundamentally to in terms of makes a good feature,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.170
we need to talk about finding one and describing one.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.750
And today we're going to talk about the notion of finding these features,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.180
sometimes referred to as interest points.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.090
And these are going to be defined to be the points of

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.350
the image that would likely make good features,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.120
that is ones that satisfy all those criteria we just talked about.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.300
So, let's start thinking about an image pattern and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.369
imagine you're looking at a large black square against the white wall, okay?

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.940
Would the middle of the square be a good interest point?

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.029
Megan, what do you think?

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.549
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:40.762
&gt;&gt; Wrong, no.

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:44.100
Look, remember one of the things we need to be able to do is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.980
precisely locate this?

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.700
Well, in order to try to find the middle of some big square,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.580
there's like nothing there.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.840
It's all black, I wouldn't know where to land.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.320
Okay, well, what about along the edge?

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.120
Will a point along the edge be a good interest point?

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.680
Megan what do you think?

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.180
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.950
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.900
Look, okay, so if my edge was vertical we're going to do this in a minute,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.330
if my edge was vertical I could tell which way to move left and right.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.410
But as I move up and down, nothing would really change, right?

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.580
I just have black on one side, white on the other side, and

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.120
this edge in the middle, and I wouldn't be able to tell where that point lands.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.090
Okay, you ready, Megan?

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.370
Two strikes.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.730
What about the top left-hand corner?

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.290
Would that be a good point?

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.130
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.810
&gt;&gt; Yes! She got it right!

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.680
Swings and hits a home run, well, a triple.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.610
That seems pretty good, right?

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.190
The idea is that, I know exactly where that point is.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.730
If I told you,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.600
go point to the left, top left hand corner, you'd know where it was.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.360
Whereas if I said, go point to the middle of the square, the exact middle,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.970
you'd look at it and say, I, I don't know.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.320
You'd have to get Megan, and she wouldn't know either, and

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.490
she'd say, oh I'm sorry.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.810
Anyway, okay, so let's take a look at this.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.560
All right.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.600
So that this really is the basic idea of corner detection, all right?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.880
So here I have a black, sort of zoomed in on a black, kind of rounded

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.030
square against a white background, where there's brown little square is, right?

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.560
I could move that square up and down or left and right.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.229
And basically the pixels underneath that square wouldn't change very much.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.450
That's what is referred to as a flat region.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.980
That is that there is no change in the intensity.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.260
Well, here's our edge.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.770
Okay, so now we've put our square over the edge.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.210
So what do we see?

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.380
Well, it's the same thing we, we talked about before.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.170
Now, I can know about moving left and right.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.650
I would know exactly more or less where that edge is.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.720
But if I were to move up and down.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.710
Okay, I wouldn't be able to see any difference,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.300
because there would be no change.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.140
So finally what do we get to, aha, we get to corners.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.180
Okay.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.980
And the idea is that in the corner, basically because I have gradience

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.190
in more than one direction, no matter how I were to translate that square,

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.820
the pattern underneath the square will change.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.510
And so I can know when I've lined up exactly where I was before, right?

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.640
So there's this idea that we need the gradients to have more than one direction.
