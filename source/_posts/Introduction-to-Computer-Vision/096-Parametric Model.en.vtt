00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.450
Today we're going to focus on finding parametric models.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.100
And what we mean by a parametric model is that it's a, it's a class.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.220
It's a class, it's a model that represents a set of instances where each

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.890
instance can be represented by a particular setting of the parameter or

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.960
the parameters.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.480
So for example, a line is a parametric model.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.450
A circle is a parametric model.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.530
And, like I said, we'll even be able to talk about a parameterized template,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.980
where you have a template but

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.330
you change it's shape according to the value of some parameters.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.320
So, when you're trying to fit a parametric model, or another way of saying is

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.860
you're trying to find a parametric model inside your image.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.220
They're essentially a cup,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.550
there are a couple of things you have to keep in mind.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.170
The first is, what parametric model are you going to use?

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.210
That is, you know, how are you going to represent,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.910
how do you go from the parameters to the thing you're representing.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.120
And in fact, today, we're going to show you that even for

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.140
something as simple as a line, how do your parameterization matters.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.270
The other thing about this model, and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.330
this actually works to our advantage, is that the membership, or

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.870
the notion that a little point in the image or an edge or

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.820
a template belongs to a model, is not determined by just looking at that edge.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.570
You actually have to look at many different edges or look at the whole model.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.420
And that notion of extended support is something we're going to

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.890
take advantage of.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.680
And then finally whenever you go looking for parametric model.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.270
You could just say well, if computers were infinitely fast, and

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.670
every time we use one they feel like they're becoming infinitely fast.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.690
Well I would just check for every possible line in all possible places.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.090
Well, the reality is that even with really, really, really, fast computers.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.830
The number of possible models is really, really, really big.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.596
So it turns out you're really, really, really, I'm losing track here.

00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:47.050
Turns out you're a really fast computer,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.600
still, you have to worry about the combinatorics of your computation
