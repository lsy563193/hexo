00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.636
So the question becomes what do we do?

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:03.404
How do we compute?

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:05.606
To figure out that a pixel in an image.

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:10.244
The pixel is some location x, y is actually an edge pixel.

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:13.614
That is that it lands on an edge or is part of an edge somewhere.

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:17.551
To think about this, we have to return to our idea of image as function.

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.121
So you remember here's our comedienne.

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:24.859
And this was two different representations of the same function.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.337
One just happens to be shown to you as a picture, so

00:00:27.337 --> 00:00:30.231
you're used to seeing that although it's pretty scary.

00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:33.056
And the other is shown as this height map,

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:36.705
where the height was proportional to the intensity.

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:40.541
And the thing that's clear is that these edges, right?

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:43.044
So this edge by the side of her face there.

00:00:43.044 --> 00:00:48.916
Is really a steep cliff by the side in, in that function.

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:49.550
Okay.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.090
And what we're going to look for fundamentally for

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.626
edges are going to be these steep changes somewhere in that image function.

00:00:58.626 --> 00:01:00.127
So it sounds pretty simple.

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:00.694
Okay.

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.830
In some little local neighborhood.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.458
Can I determine that I'm in a,

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:07.601
at a location where there's going to be a very strong change?

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.036
Doesn't seem so hard.

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:12.710
Well, there are two things that we have to sort of answer in order to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.707
be able to do this.

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:17.311
If we're trying to look at a neighborhood with strong signs of change.

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:20.347
We had this question of well, how big is a neighborhood?

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:22.450
And then what do you mean detecting change?

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.051
How much of change is change?

00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:27.154
And, and how are we going to determine exactly where that change is?

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:29.261
So, so here's an example of a function and

00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:33.194
the idea is that, you know, probably the edge might be thought of as like that.

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:36.097
Our first problem of course, is we don't get to do that.

00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:39.334
We have to pick the pixels that we say are the edge.

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:40.101
Right?

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:43.650
We don't get to say it's between, well, we could say, it's between pixels but

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.206
we, we tend not to do that, right?

00:01:45.206 --> 00:01:49.276
So the idea here is that the 80s are on one side and these 20s and

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:53.660
30s are on another side, so we have to try to go about finding those.
