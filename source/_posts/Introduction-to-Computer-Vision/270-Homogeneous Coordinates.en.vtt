00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:05.170
So just reviewing in homogeneous coordinates, given two points, p1 and p2,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.740
if I ask you to find the line, no problem.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.320
Just take their cross product, l is p1 p2.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.560
No algebra required while doing cross-product.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.490
No thinking about lines, equations or something Mrs.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.690
Murphy taught you in eighth grade about how to go from.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.700
No, you just take the cross product.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.982
Likewise, if I have two lines a1x, b1y, c1 equals zero.

00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:29.880
A2x plus b2y plus c2 equals zero, and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.650
I want to know the intersection of those two lines.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.240
That actually took a little bit of work in Mrs. Murphy's class, right?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.160
If I gave you the equation of two lines and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.270
I told you to find their intersection, you had to think about, well,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.930
I have to sort of make them equal and solve these two sum.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.140
No, you just cross them.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.420
You know why Mrs. Murphy didn't teach you that?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.150
She didn't know.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.130
It's a long story about algebra teachers.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.350
Anyway, cool.
