All right, well welcome to computer vision, you know hopefully,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.930
from the introduction, you feel, inspired to charge through here.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.900
And what we're going to do is we're going to start of easy, and and frankly,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.240
we'll get kind of hard towards the end, which is okay,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.340
because, by the time you get there you'll be, ready to do that.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.900
So today, we're going to talk about images, the most of you think about images

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.360
as, something you see on a screen, or if you're old school, like me, something

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.290
that's actually printed in a magazine, you know, it's something you can look at.
