00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.410
A, a simple example is shown here.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.430
Here is a sphere, you could sort of tell that it's a sphere, right?

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.670
It falls of down here so we're looking straight down.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.610
With five different illuminations.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.660
When we do photometric stereo on that, remember we can recover both surface

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.890
normal and the albedo, and that's what this looks like here, right?

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.600
So the albedo, you can see that it recovered,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.570
the fact that it's got these four quadrants.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.040
So even though this thing falls off slowly,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.590
it knows that it's all the same albedo.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.770
And then this is the estimated of the surface normals.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.090
And so this is what's sometimes called the needle diagram, where you're

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.230
looking at where the needles are pointing, that's the surface normal.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.400
Now you can actually do this somewhat for real.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.040
So, here's an example where there are four input images, so

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.290
the lighting is coming from different directions, right?

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.570
You can see here, you get different kind of shading, right?

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.360
And it recovers both the albedo, which is sort of the paint, the color.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.420
And you can see that it actually knows that there are these stripes on

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.280
there along with the surface normals.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.580
So it recovered the shape.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.130
In fact, there's a really cool app you can download from this

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.960
company called trimensional.com, and this is not a commercial endorsement.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.630
It's just a Georgia Tech endorsement.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.400
This was an app put together by Grant Schindler where you basically,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.900
I don't know if he's got it on Androids now as well but

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.520
certainly at the time it was on iPhones.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.210
And you take pictures from different locations and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.040
it uses the light to illuminate it.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.760
And it does a surface reconstruction.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.260
All right?

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.712
And it works pretty cool and download it and I think it's it might be free.

00:01:41.712 --> 00:01:43.700
I know it might be a dollar, maybe it's four.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.940
Whatever it is, if you, if you buy it, grant, send me
