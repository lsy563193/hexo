00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.220
What makes a good feature?

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.270
So here, I have a picture just as an example.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.510
The first thing is, it's called Repeatability/Precision.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.740
The same feature should be found in several or

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.200
multiple images of the same scene.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.970
Now, of course these aren't all the same picture.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.650
Because, if I gave you 15 copies of the same picture.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.290
This would be a really boring class, all right?

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.620
These are actually different pictures of the same scene, so

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.690
things change a little bit.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.750
But despite those changes, I want to get the same points being identified, and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.140
that's repeatability, and also.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.820
I'd like it to be the active same point.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.400
All right, so there's this little red dot on top of the camera,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.280
there's one over here too.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.810
I wonder which one I'm looking at.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.560
See I'm going to make Megan cut back, and forth in her video.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.940
Okay, the little red dot.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.680
So that dot's a pretty good feature, because there's only two of them that I'm

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.700
looking at here, so I can find both of them, and

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.820
then matching will probably be easy to do and then they're very precise.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.860
That is I'm not going to drift around,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.110
I'm going to be able to find right on that dot.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.540
The next thing is Salience or Matchability.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.340
This is how distinctive the descriptor is.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.460
So each feature should be able to be described uniquely enough

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.470
that it's easy to find it right.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.430
So if I'm looking at a bunch of white dots on a black wall, and

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.570
they're all the same white dot.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.960
That's really a problem, because that's the George, George, George, George,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.070
George, right, everybody is named George, I can't find anybody, I just quit and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.420
go home, all right?

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.580
So, you like to have a description that's different, about them.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.530
Compactness and efficiency.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.040
Another way of saying this is, don't get carried away.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.590
You remember when we talked about computing the fundamental matrix,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.540
we said well, I only need eight corresponding points, but

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.710
I mean maybe having a dozen or 20 of them might be better.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.020
Maybe even 50, but 50 is much, much, much,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.130
much, much, much, much, much smaller than the number of pixels in the image.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.140
So, what I would really like to do is, in general, I don't want to have

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.810
a feature everywhere, although in this picture, there's a lot of them.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.170
But you see, even here, it looks like there's a lot of them, but

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.270
I don't know, maybe there's a 100.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.290
But there's tens of thousands of pixels here.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.620
So, that's what it means by being compact and efficient.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.180
And finally, Locality.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.880
Locality is,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.430
is not what you think if you think locality means exactly knowing where it is.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.250
That was the precision.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.080
Locality means that, the descriptor that I compute about the feature,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.350
the description, the name, is based upon information that comes just.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.300
&gt;From a pretty small area around the feature.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.840
Now you might think that you know I'd like to take a nice big area

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.670
to describe it because that'll give me a nice very distinct description.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.230
That's like a first name, and a second name, and

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.360
third name, and a fourth name would be giving me a very rich description.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.330
The problem is and I'll try to find, oh yeah it's right over here.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.940
So I'm looking at the side of this.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.830
Now I'm I hope I'm still in the feed.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.400
No, the camera moved!

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.740
I'm looking.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.450
Okay, good.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.260
Thank you.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.630
So I'm looking at the side of the, of the lens over here, and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.560
the problem is if I take too much of the lens to describe what's going on,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.300
as I move over here, and I start to get occluded.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.370
A bunch of that neighborhood goes away.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.640
That's the same thing when we had,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.690
you know, a finger getting occluded a little bit by the other.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.870
So since I'm trying to find matching pixels from different views, and

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.800
different views will cause a little bit of occlusion to change,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.770
I don't want the neighborhood that I use to describe the, the,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.880
to make the description to be too large.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.590
And that's what locality means.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.170
It makes us more robust to sort of clutter, and occlusion.
