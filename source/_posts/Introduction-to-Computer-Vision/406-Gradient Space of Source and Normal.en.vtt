00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.200
Let's suppose I have two vectors so

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.880
I'm working from a point I've got two vectors.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.410
I've got a vector S, that's in the direction of my source and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.090
a vector N, that's in the direction of the normal of the surface.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.980
All right.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.260
Well those vectors are whatever they are.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.210
Their unit vectors are sort of small s, small n.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.210
So, remember I can project any vector up on the pq plain,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.660
and that's what this is.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.056
This is at the z=1 pq plain.

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:38.497
So I've got a pq for the normal, out of the surface and I've got like p sub s,

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:43.820
q sub s for the vector that is in the direction of the light source.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.770
So when I write that I get the following, right?

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.870
Remember I said that our unit vector n is just p q one divided by

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.490
the magnitude of p squared plus q squared plus one squared square root of.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.710
And likewise, the unit vector in the direction of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.170
the source is this p s q s one divided by its magnitude, all right?

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.030
So far so good.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.020
So we have an algebraic equation of both of those normals.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.390
So let's suppose for a moment we have a Lambertian surface, then the only thing

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.180
that determines, in terms of the geometry here, the amount of brightness

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.560
that we see is just this angle i, which is kind of lost in this mess here.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.460
But there it is, it's the angle between those two vectors.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.990
And what I need to know of course, is the cosine of that angle, right?

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.070
That's the Lambertian surface equation.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.922
Well, given all of this algebra, we can represent that cosine as follows, right?

00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:48.840
The cosine of that angle is just the dot product of those two unit normals.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.500
So it's the dot product of n, dot product of s.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.070
Which is the dot product of these quantities which is written right there.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.830
Okay?

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.460
So that, that is the representation in pq

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.570
space of what that cosine of that angle is.
