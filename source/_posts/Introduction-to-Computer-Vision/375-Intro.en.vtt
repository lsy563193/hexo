00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.239
All right. Welcome back to computer vision today and the next couple of lessons.

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:09.934
We're going to just a little bit of time on the whole light reflection process

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:14.650
that results in photos essentially hitting our camera or our retina.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.979
The idea this is how the physics of the imaging or

00:00:17.979 --> 00:00:22.690
the creation of the light that the imaging is going to make a picture of.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.864
And there's actually a huge amount known about, and, about this area, and

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:31.161
it comes from both, sort of, the material science, where we study the materials,

00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:34.568
but the big, motivator has been computer graphics, right?

00:00:34.568 --> 00:00:38.682
Computer graphics, the idea is I have some model of of an object and

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:41.642
its surface type and I have some model of the light.

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:45.465
And I'd like to produce an image as if you were actually looking at

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:46.515
the real object.

00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:51.052
So to do that, I have to understand how light interacts with these objects.

00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:53.888
Now in the old days and when I say, the old days.

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:56.024
I mean, like 20 to 40 years ago.

00:00:56.024 --> 00:00:58.791
There was this view that computer vision was

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.495
just inverse computer graphics, right?

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:04.788
I mean, computer graphics, you have model of the object and a model of light and

00:01:04.788 --> 00:01:05.633
you make a picture.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.742
And computer vision was thought of as well,

00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:11.739
given a picture, can you tell me about the light and the object that's there.

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:16.434
And so there was a lot of focus on recovering image prop surface properties and

00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:21.348
object properties and light and conditions as it's sort of an inverse problem.

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:22.252
And to do that,

00:01:22.252 --> 00:01:26.787
we had to have a lot of understanding of the physics of how images were formed.

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:30.115
Now more recently in computer vision a lot of what we've talked about here,

00:01:30.115 --> 00:01:32.767
there's been more of a focus on really the geometry of sort of

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:34.119
where features get located and

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.187
that relates to sort of the, the shapes of objects and the relation and

00:01:37.187 --> 00:01:40.355
you didn't have to worry quite so much about the precise physics.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:42.004
And then also a lot was saying,

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.939
let's lump all together, the lighting, the shape.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.975
The texture, the imaging, the camera, et cetera.

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:51.389
We just get out pictures and we use machine learning or

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:54.882
recognition techniques for to trying to do labeling.

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:59.448
And we talked and when we will actually be talking about that in the future.

00:01:59.448 --> 00:02:03.499
But it is it's still important to understand something about how the physics of

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:05.620
light works with respect to making images.
