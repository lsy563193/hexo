00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.590
That's all the physics we're going to do.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.000
We've talked about how we, model the light, and

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.270
we talked about surface property, so the albedo of the mat reflectance, and

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.300
sort of the specular component, and

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.040
we've talked about how the shape, the surface normals, interacts with that.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.380
So in computer vision, there are these fundamental questions of,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.792
well, when I look at a, a scene, can I figure out, say the shape, or

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:30.780
the albedo or both, just from an image that I'm, that I'm looking at.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.230
And so fundamentally, this is an ill-posed problem, right,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.540
because it's an interaction between both the shape and the whatever's painted,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.270
or the texture on the surface, and yet our brain does it all the time, which

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.860
means that we, as computer vision scientists, we'd like to try to do it, too.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.230
So over the next couple of lessons, we'll be talking, sort of,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.830
the computer vision approach to recovering those elements.
