00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.300
So in our polar representation,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.380
this purplish line here is going to
be defined by two quantities.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.720
One of them is just this distance, d.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.098
This is the distance of a line to
the origin, the perpendicular distance.

00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:16.500
It's the distant to the closest
point on the line to the origin.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.780
And the second parameter, so
that first parameter is d, and

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.650
the second parameter's theta.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.240
which is just the angle,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.630
that this perpendicular makes with
the x-axis, or if you want, you

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.450
can have it be the angle that the line
makes with the axis, doesn't matter.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.310
You just have to pick an angle.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.710
So basically what we have now is
a polar representation of an angle.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.120
And a distance.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.230
In such a representation,
by doing just a little bit of math,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.220
you can basically see that the dot
product of any point on the line xy.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.330
Dotted with the cosine theta, sine theta
location of this normal is equal to d.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.570
There's a lot of ways to do it but
basically you can show that if you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.740
formulate it this way, that x
cosine(theta) + y sine(theta) = d.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.319
So it's a lot, not a lot,
it's a little bit ugly.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.630
Well, it's beautiful if
you like trigonometry.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.710
It's ugly if you like algebra.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.070
It's a little bit more ugly than
the y equals mx plus b formulation.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.230
But it doesn't have this problem that
any of our lines are ill-defined.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.060
This is a perfectly fine way
of representing any line.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.670
You can have any direction you want.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.930
Theta can go however it wants to go.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.970
And you can be,
you can go right through the origin.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.630
D can be zero, or
it can get as big as you need it to go.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.420
One of the interesting things now is
if you take a look at this equation.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.460
If I know x and y, what I have
left in terms of d and theta.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.030
Is a sinusoid, all right?

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.010
Which is why we say that a point in
image space is now a sinusoid in Hough

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.900
space, and we'll see an example
of that in a minute.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.010
See, before, we had this beautiful
duality of a point in image space was

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.800
a line in Hough space, and a point in
Hough space was a line in image space.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.040
Well, because we've introduced this
cosines and sines, it's still a duality,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.170
but it's no longer simply
between points and lines.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.280
One other comment about this, there's
a redundancy or an ambiguity here.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.400
Let me draw it to you this way.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.570
Here's d, so

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.720
if d can only be positive, this line has
to be able to spin all the way around.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.340
So theta would have to go from zero
to two pi, zero to 360 degrees.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.562
But If d could be positive or negative.

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:31.700
Then theta only has to
go from zero to pi.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.748
Or zero to minus pi and
how you draw that.

00:02:33.748 --> 00:02:36.660
The idea is you'd only need
a 180 degrees worth of coverage.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.200
Which way you do it
doesn't really matter and

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200
our algorithm will do
it in a particular way.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.730
But there's just this trade-off
between if you let d go positive

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.000
to negative top has it negative
then only it has to go zero to pi.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.860
In fact,
you can restrict things even more

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.580
if you make this be the origin of
your image, the top left-hand corner.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.505
If you're going to say that your
line has to be within the image.

00:03:01.505 --> 00:03:03.480
Okay?
Then that restricts even more

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.800
because it has to cut off that quadrant,
so theta and d are restricted even more.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.440
But these are just choices that
you make in terms of how you code

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.010
up the algorithm.
