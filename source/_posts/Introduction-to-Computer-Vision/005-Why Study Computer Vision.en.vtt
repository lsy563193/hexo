00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.719
If that’s computer is, vision is why would you want to study this?

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.400
Well, I mean, a, you might want to get a Masters in

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.290
Computer Science degree at Georgia Tech, and everything else was filled.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.720
And you got stuck with Bob, and well, so here you are.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.340
But there’s actually some really good reasons to do that.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.466
These days images and imagery have become ubiquitous in all of our technology.

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.223
cameras, video, you can stream them, you can send them etc.

00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:25.374
So what's become fundamental to an awful lot of

00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:29.330
systems is the manipulation in the processing of imagery.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.560
And extracting information from that.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.660
There are domains such as surveillance.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.540
There are building 3D models for medical imaging.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.570
Or capturing for motion capture.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.330
These are all different current industries that leverage computer vision in

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.780
a variety of ways.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.500
But most of all, the reason to do it is, it is just a really cool and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.810
deep set of problems.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.160
And it's way more fun that learning how to build compilers.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.840
And now, I have to go apologize to all my compiler friends, but

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.650
they know it's true.
