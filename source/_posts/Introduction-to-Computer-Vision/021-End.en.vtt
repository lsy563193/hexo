All right. So, look, that ends the motivation and sort of what computer vision

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.835
is and why you might do it and how we're going to do it in this class.

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:09.800
Arvid, you have anything else you want to add?

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.850
I just hope that you're excited about the course by now.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.530
To make sure that you don't listen to the entire course like a podcast,

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.420
I'm going to step in with some annoying little quizzes.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.550
&gt;&gt; Annoying, huh?

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.120
&gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.950
&gt;&gt; They we'll find out.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:24.550
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.720
Arvid has been practicing all his life about how to be annoying,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.080
that's what his mother told me.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.460
So I think he's got it down.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.840
But anyway, it's time we get started, it's a bit of work but

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.330
I think if if you do it, you'll learn a lot of computer vision, so

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.350
let's strap ourselves in and just get going.
