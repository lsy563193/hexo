00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:00.930
Hi.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.180
Welcome to the Introduction to Computer Vision.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.300
I'm Professor Aaron Bobick here at Georgia Tech.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.480
I'm thrilled to be able to teach this course in this medium.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.240
I've been teaching this for quite a while.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.390
I've been a professor for, oh my gosh, almost 25 years in computer vision.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.960
Spent some time at the MIT Media Lab, and

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.400
I've been at Georgia Tech for the last 15 years.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.520
My own research has been predominantly in activity recognition.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.590
And now it's moved a little more to robotics in terms of vision for

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.190
robots understanding people.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.240
But the basics of this course is,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.424
is to cover sort of the fundamentals of computer vision,

00:00:31.424 --> 00:00:35.340
to give you a background enough that you could just enough to be dangerous.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.530
So before we tell you more about the course, it's important that you meet

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.720
a couple of other people who are responsible for the success of this course.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.120
And it will be a success or I'll be really, really annoyed and, and then people,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.580
see everybody's going to see this and they'll think really poorly of me.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.880
Anyway, the first person you have to meet is probably the most important person

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.990
in making this a success, no pressure, is Dr.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.490
Arpin Chuckarvarde who is our course developer.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.050
Come on over, Arpin.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.370
So tell the good folks at home or

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.890
sitting at their desks at work a little something about yourself.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.520
&gt;&gt; Sure I got my PhD from North Carolina State University in

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.820
biologically inspired computer vision.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.090
&gt;&gt; What is, what is that?

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.170
&gt;&gt; Oh you take human vision systems and animal vision systems.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.230
Study them, how they function and use those ideas in an artificial setting.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.230
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.720
And what made you want to do this course development work.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.710
Well I heard that Udacity is making this

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.850
online computer vision course with Georgia Tech and I thought,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.750
this is a good way to use the knowledge I've put together over the years.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.120
&gt;&gt; Okay, great, well thanks, and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.540
you guys will be hearing more from Arpin as the time goes on.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.885
So the other really important person you have to meet is Megan Smith.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:43.655
Megan is our video guru.

00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:46.950
She is the film person, the editing person, the production person.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.580
She makes my hair look non-existent and yeah, just makes everything look great.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.300
She also allows me to illustrate the difference between the illusion of

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.990
power and actual power.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.770
See, the illusion of power is I can call Megan over and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.760
she'll probably come over and say hello.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.180
Megan, come on over and say hello.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.100
Say hello to everybody.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.470
&gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; The reason I say that that's the illusion of power.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.220
The person who has the real power is Megan because she does the video editing.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.750
So, if she wanted to, she could make me look incredibly foolish.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.073
But, you would never do that, would you?

00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:21.509
[SOUND].

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:22.761
Never.

00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:24.610
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.732
Okay, well you'll be hearing from her sometimes when we ask some questions and

00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:30.340
she makes some interesting noises in the background.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.656
But I just wanted you to put a,

00:02:31.656 --> 00:02:35.560
a face with the beautiful melodic voice that you'll be hearing later.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.190
So thanks, Megan.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.720
All right, so that's the crew.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.010
And I think this is going to be a good time.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.280
I mean it's maybe, maybe, okay.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.160
Maybe that's a little bit much.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.230
I think you'll enjoy the class.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.370
There is a lot to be learned.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.860
We can't actually cover all of computer vision, but

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.190
we can sort of go over a whole bunch of the fundamentals and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.570
I think you'll learn a lot if you actually do the work.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.550
And it is a bunch of work, I don't want to, I don't want to pretend otherwise.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.570
But if you do it I think you'll come away with the ability to do

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.740
things that you couldn't do before.
