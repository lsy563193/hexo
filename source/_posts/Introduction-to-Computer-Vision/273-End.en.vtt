00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.930
All right, that ends today's, relatively short lesson.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.740
We've just, a flavor of projective geometry.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.000
There are entire, I want to say books,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.140
there are entire lifetimes dedicated to projective geometry, mostly in France.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.802
They've got this thing about it.

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:19.402
But in particular, out of France, came from [FOREIGN] group and

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:23.510
others was the application of projected geometry to computer vision.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.460
And it really revolutionized some of the, the work that was done in terms of

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.630
how people thought about stereo and other types of relationship between views.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.230
What we're going to do, is we're going to discuss,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.880
we're going to use this a little bit in our next two lectures where we

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.960
talk about what's called the essential matrix, and the fundamental matrix.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.370
Those are a little more intense, so hang on.
