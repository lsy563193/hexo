00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.719
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:04.710
I hope it's welcome back because if you're jumping in now

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.168
you missed some really good jokes and some of the better lectures.

00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:10.550
the, this one's okay, actually.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.000
Anyway, today we're going to talk about extrinsic camera calibration.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.660
We'll define what that means in a minute.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.300
We took a little hiatus to talk about stereo so

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.800
you guys could get working on your stereo, and

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.760
stereo was our first look at multiview geometry, multiview cameras.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.770
And we talked about how, in order to do real depth reconstruction,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.140
we have to understand the geometry of what's gong on between the cameras, and

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.650
that's what we're going to start talking about today.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.450
So, before the stereo thing, the stereo sections,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.340
we introduced a projection, perspective projection.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.520
And here is the model that we used.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.680
In particular, we had a system where we went, where we had a center of

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.480
projection that was located at the origin of a three-dimensional camera system.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.590
And then we derived from simu, similar triangles the location on

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.020
the image of the point projected down onto the image plane.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.030
And then in order to figure out where the point was going to land on the image,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.600
we just eliminated that last coordinate.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.570
Now we said that this was a bit of an issue because this division by Z

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.180
was non-linear.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.240
And because we had to pull out the particular Z,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.260
it wasn't a constant Z, it was the particular Z.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.660
So we introduced this notion of homogeneous coordinates.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.500
And the homogeneous coordinates essentially added an,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.250
another component to the vector.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.130
And if it was 2D, it became a three long vector, 3D became four.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.680
And the idea was, that we were going to be able to convert from

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.400
homogenous to non-homogenous when we needed it.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.990
But before we did that,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.750
all of our operations could be done through matrix multiplication.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.373
Which, by the way made homogenous coordinates, the whole thing,

00:01:51.373 --> 00:01:52.282
invariant under scale.

00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:55.763
I could scale a coordinate, homogenous coordinate by anything and

00:01:55.763 --> 00:01:58.790
when I did the, the normalization, divide by w here.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.410
It would go away.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.640
And, one of the reasons we did this is we said that perspective projection

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.740
could now be done as a matrix multiplication.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.820
So, here I've written, one, one, and here, we've got 1 over f.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.680
And by the way, just to make life easier, I'm using the absolute value of z, so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.100
we don't have to worry about z being positive or negative.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.420
So, when I do the multiplication, I get this homogeneous coordinate.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.060
And when I want to normalize and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.870
go to unhomogeneous, I get the u v by dividing it out.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.250
But in all of this discussion about projection,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.350
we have the notion of a camera's coordinate system.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.030
By the way, I'm going to go like this.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.920
And it's not some like, weird curse in Georgia.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.050
It's, it's a coordinate system, one, two, three.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.250
Okay, so we have an origin and a coordinate system.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.330
And we said that we put the center of projection at the camera's

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.040
coordinate system.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.460
And we have the z axis, the optic axis going down the z axis.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.460
So to do geometric reasoning about the world, we need to know,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.650
we need to be able to relate the coordinate system of the,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.110
I guess I'm going to have to do this.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.370
We have to relate the coordinate system of

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.320
the world to the coordinate system of the camera.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.518
And, in fact, today, what we'll do is the coordinate system from the world to

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:08.283
the camera, and then next, I don't know,

00:03:08.283 --> 00:03:10.902
today, I don't know when you're going to watch it, next month.

00:03:10.902 --> 00:03:14.628
The next lesson will be the coordinate system from the camera 3D

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:16.700
coordinate system, to the image.
