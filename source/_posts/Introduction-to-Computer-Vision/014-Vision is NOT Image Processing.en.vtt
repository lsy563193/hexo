00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.100
So in that example, the thing to realize is

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.611
those two squares that have the same measurement of intensity.

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:08.850
All right?

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.250
So seeing is not the same thing as just measuring image properties.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.950
In fact, seeing is called, we refer to it as building a percept,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.410
a build up a description in your head of what's actually going on there,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.640
based upon what's in the measurements.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.550
That can be illustrated in a couple of ways.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.910
Here's one, so this is a very, very old stereoscope.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.260
This is a slide borrowed from Michael Black.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.030
And we'll talk about this in detail when we do stereo.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.520
And if, and the, the stereoscope here is designed so

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.210
that one image goes through one eye, and the other image goes to the other eyes.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.880
So, here they, here they are.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.780
If you take a look at those two images, this is the left image, and

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.050
this is the right image.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.750
Left, right, left, right.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.150
It's the difference between those two images that let's your brain realize that

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.000
the dad holding the kid is in front of the bed where the mom is.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.890
Okay, and it's that difference you're building that

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.700
description from the difference between those images.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.170
So I'm going to show you a video now from Dan Kersten that shows you

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.530
that perception is an active construction on the part of your head.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.210
So here, there's going to be this ball rolling back and

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.350
forth, okay, and the ball's going to do the same thing, but

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.270
the shadows are going to do something different.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.208
Ready, watch.

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:24.019
Whoa.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:25.830
Okay.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.710
So let's do that again.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.960
So you see the ball, and the shadow goes with it, and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.650
you see the ball going to the back corner of the checkerboard.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.800
And now, we move the shadow sideways, and you see the ball lifting up.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.330
The ball did the same thing in both cases.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.320
All right?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.560
But your brain, because of the shadow, says the ball did something different.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.430
So again, that’s not a property of measurement.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.580
So here’s another example.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.230
So what you’re going to see is what looks like a green piece of paper or

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.890
something on a checkerboard.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.070
You saw that green thing lift up.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.150
Right? You saw it come right off the checkerboard, right?

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.900
Let's do it again, all right?

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.530
Here we go, it comes up off the checkerboard, right?

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.410
Just look at the top left-hand corner of that green thing,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.870
and you will see that absolutely nothing moves.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.700
None of the green pixels move at all.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.120
The only thing that moves are those darkish pixels,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.640
which your brain says is a cast shadow.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.960
So that means your brain had to pretend there was some illuminant up in the sky

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.440
over here, making these shadows.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.990
And the only explanation is that the,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.140
the green thing came up off the, the, the checkerboard.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.969
So it's another example of your brain doing this construction.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.260
So the previous examples I was showing you,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.850
are in some sense the human system doing something wrong, right?

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.620
The ball didn't actually change what it did.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.220
But actually, what happened there is that, there's ambiguity as to what the ball

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.860
is doing, and your brain is creating the story, it is making the description,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.530
and the difference between straight image processing and

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.360
computer vision is building that description.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.750
And we're going to show you some of the methods that you would use to help do

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.480
that construction.
