00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.800
All right. So let's begin our trip down computer vision lane here.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.610
So the first question you might ask is, what is computer vision?

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.460
&gt;&gt; What is computer vision?

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.900
&gt;&gt; See, I told you you were going to hear from Megan.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.330
Well, there's a couple of ways of thinking about it.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.630
I like this slide that I borrowed from Steve Seitz,

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.600
where he talks about every picture tells a story.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.740
And one way of thinking about computer vision is the goal of

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.700
computer vision is to interpret images.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.920
That is, say something about what's present in the scene or

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.080
what's actually going on.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.020
So, what we're doing is, we're going to take images in,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.340
and what's going to come out is something that has some meaning to it.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.600
That is, we're going to extract,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.160
we're going to create some sort of interpretations,

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.900
some sort of an understanding of what that image is representative of.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.550
This is different, many of you may have some exposure to image processing,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.260
which is the manipulation of images.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.220
That's images in and images out.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.730
And we'll talk a little bit about that because you use image processing for

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.430
per, for computer vision.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.120
But fundamentally computer vision is about understanding something

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.240
that's in the image.
