00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.236
So that's one way you impose a
constraint on the flow field in general.

00:00:05.236 --> 00:00:09.268
It has some strengths like one of the
strengths are that it allows you to bias

00:00:09.268 --> 00:00:13.428
your solution with a particular prior
that is like you really prefer smooth or

00:00:13.428 --> 00:00:15.163
maybe you prefer more.

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:18.916
You, you work some constraint
into a general overall thing.

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:22.390
I will tell you that in general there
are much better ways of doing it than

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.160
this, in particular imposing constraints
on a local basis and guess what?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.170
That's what we'll do next time.
