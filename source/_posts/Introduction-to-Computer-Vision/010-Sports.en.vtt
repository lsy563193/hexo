00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.390
Another big economic place for computer vision is sports.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.350
If you watch any sort of professional sports on TV,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.610
you see them leveraging computer vision sometimes in powerful ways,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.320
sometimes in simple ways but are really useful.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.890
So here, this is Sportvision first down line for American football.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.410
I say American football because sometimes when I go to Europe and

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.740
I say football they think a ball is round.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.640
We know that footballs are not round.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.610
And what's interesting about this line here is this is the line that he has to

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.290
cross to make a first down.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.720
Of course that's not on the field, it's drawn in there.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.750
The only interesting computer vision that's going on here is you'll notice that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.280
that line does not go through him.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.530
So the system had to separate out the player from the background, okay?

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.860
And even though, by the way, kind of greenish color in there,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.710
it's able to separate the grass from the player.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.760
In fact, if you ever watch one of these games when it's rainy and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.830
it's an outdoor field and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.120
it gets all muddy, the first down line stops working so well.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.140
Because the grass is now mud and it doesn't look like grass anymore and

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.000
it can't tell the players and the whole thing doesn't work so well.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.920
And you can see a computer vision failure right there.
