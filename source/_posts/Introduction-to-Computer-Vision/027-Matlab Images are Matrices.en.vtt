00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.320
Most of you, I hope,

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.840
will use either MATLAB or Octave for, for the work in this class.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.630
We talked about how you can use also Python and OpenCV, etcetera.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.040
MATLAB or the open source version of it of Octave makes it easy.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.150
If you're an actually student somewhere, you know,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.220
really registered somewhere, there is a student edition of MATLAB.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.000
It is less than most textbooks and a great thing for you to purchase.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.670
So, in MATLAB, images and matrices just work really well.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.220
So, you know, here's all it takes to read an image.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.470
Right? So we've got this function, imread, and

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.480
we're going to read in as a file peppers.png.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.810
And by the way, if you don't put these semicolons in there,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.700
MATLAB spits out all the numbers, which is incredibly painful.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.600
And then what we're going to do here is, I'm going to take just

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.920
the green channel, and the green channel can be indexed because in,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.140
in MATLAB, images have a certain number of rows, certain number of columns, and

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.180
you can think of this as the color planes or the layers.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.660
So when I say im of colon that means all the rows comma colon all the columns.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.989
And then 2 that's red, green, blue.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.820
So that's green.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.430
Now some of you are screaming, no, Professor Bobic, you messed up.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.730
I will certainly mess up in this class.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.630
Although I will mess up less frequently in this class then in my

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.110
in class, class.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.670
Why? Because Megan hates to see me mess up.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.300
That's actually not really true, she likes to put it in there, but anyway.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.170
No, unfortunately, I did not mess up, or fortunately?

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.670
I don't know.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.570
MATLAB indexing starts at one.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.450
In, sort of,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.410
normal computer, zero would be red, one would be green, two would be blue.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.610
In MATLAB indices, indexing of arrays, it starts with one.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.810
So one is red, two is green, three is blue.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.300
That means that we all the time have to be subtracting one off of indices in

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.320
order to be able to multiply them to get into other locations,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.250
the computer scientists out there will know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.490
Just remember that MATLAab is one based indexing.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.900
So we've got our green channel, which is just a single channel.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.160
Well, I can just show that.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.220
And if I can imshow, we'll talk about that in a minute.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.949
Well, green has just got a single layer, so

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.030
it thinks of it as a grayscale image,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.170
and I am showing this case would just display it.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.810
And then you'll notice, MATLAB makes it really easy to plot things also.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.390
So it says draw a line, and it, can you see that red line in there?

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.100
It just drew a line right across there.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.280
Ain't MATLAB great?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.885
In fact, I can also just call plot.

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:32.619
So what this is, is this says, give me the 256th row.

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.610
Give me all the columns and then plot it, and you'll just get a plot.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.350
By the way, I recommend highly getting used to sort of exploring your image.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.770
Plotting the values and being able to see is what's going on,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:45.920
what really should be going on?
