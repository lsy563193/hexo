00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.180
Hello and
welcome to the Computer Vision class.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.290
I'm Irfan Essa and I'm a professor here
in the School of Interactive Computing

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.040
and the College of
Computing in Georgia Tech.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.810
This is a class on computer vision.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.460
It's aimed at covering the foundational
aspects of how to analyze images and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.730
to extract content from images.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.550
That is, how can we build a computer or
a machine that can see and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.590
interpret an image.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.905
First what do I mean by foundational?

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:30.236
I mean that we are going to
cover the mathematical and

00:00:30.236 --> 00:00:34.249
computational methods to provide
you with core concepts of how

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:37.140
can a computer be built
to interpret images.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.015
Notice I am using the word interpret.

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:44.290
In Computer Vision we are interested
in extracting information,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.680
knowledge from an image.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.490
Many want to go beyond processing
an image to really knowing what

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.880
is inside the image,
what's the content of the image.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.680
So we will learn the math and the basic
concepts how to compute with an image

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.180
and extract information from it.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.430
So this class will have lectures,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.000
of course what is a class
without without a lecture?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.710
All the video lectures are by my
friend and colleague Aaron Balik.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.410
And I'm biased but
I've known Aaron for a long time and

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.770
I can tell you he's a great lecturer.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.860
He actually and
seriously thinks he's funny but

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.480
I guess I will let you
be the judge of that.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.256
I've known Aaron for over 20 years
now and we've worked together.

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:27.380
I started at MIT and I learn computer
vision early days at MIT also.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.940
And then we were both
here at Georgia Tech for

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.980
a while, until he decided recently
to become Dean of Engineering

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.830
at the Washington University
in St Louis.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.480
So bidding him farewell, and
since I really do love this material and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.200
Computer Vision, I've decided to
take over this class from now on.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.290
So the video lectures are still
going to be by Aaron,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.810
but I will now manage
an able team of TA's and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.870
course developers over the term and
will work with them to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.590
provide additional material like
the assignments and exams for this term.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.160
I'll also be the one you will hear from
on various communication channels for

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.750
this class.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.570
It's now back quickly to a bit
more about Computer Vision.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.120
Computer Vision is really
about analyzing images and

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.270
videos to extract knowledge from them.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.370
Mostly these images are of real scenes
like that of a street image with

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.120
cars and such where autonomous vehicle
they'll have to navigate through or

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.420
it could be other types of images like
that of an X-ray inside a human head and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.860
we need to do image analysis to
be able to extract things about

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.330
of interest in medical applications.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.390
So essentially the goal is image and
video understanding which means

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.580
labeling interesting things in an image
and also tracking them as they move.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.690
In this class you will learn
about the foundations of how to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.905
build systems that can do this
kind of image understanding.

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:50.760
In addition to math and
the foundational theoretical context,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.430
you will also learn about doing
a series of assignments to give you

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.410
real hands on experience
with computer vision.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.390
I look forward to seeing
all of you online and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.425
engage with you as you learn
this exciting material.
