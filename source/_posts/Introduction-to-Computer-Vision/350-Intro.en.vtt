00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.839
And welcome back to computer vision.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.770
With today's lesson and the next we're going to close a circle that

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.000
we started it seems like forever ago.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.207
I remember we were talking about trying to compute transformations between

00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:15.011
images, and we talked about doing panoramas and mosaics, and o,

00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:16.961
and other ways of doing this, and we said, and

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:20.260
also when we're talking about fundamental matrices.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.450
Key to all of these things was if we knew the correspondences,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.665
you could compute the various transforms whether it's or something else.

00:00:27.665 --> 00:00:30.191
Then we talked about competing features, and

00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:33.220
feature points detections, and descriptions.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.200
So today we'll finish the story,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.590
where we're going to actually do the approach for doing feature-based alignment.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.880
We'll describe it as a form of model fitting,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.740
since, really that's what you're doing, we'll show you more about that.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.170
And then, we'll talk about a really cool method that let's you effectively find

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.250
the best global solution, or probabilistically the best global solution,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.290
without being too exhaustive, too combinatorically challenging.
