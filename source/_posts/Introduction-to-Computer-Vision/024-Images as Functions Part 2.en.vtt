00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.969
So, let's talk a little bit more about images as functions, all right?

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.220
So, we can think of an image as a function, f, sometimes we'll say f,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.560
sometimes we'll say I.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.940
That maps, you know, to, from R squared to R.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.540
That is, it goes from an x y to some pure intensity or

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.020
value at that position x y.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.420
But we're not going to have, sort of,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.240
arbitrary functions, we're going to limit them in certain ways.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.330
For us, an image is going to be defined to be over some bound.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.040
So x ranges from a to b.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.729
And y ranges from c to d.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:38.150
And the intensity ranges from some min to some max.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.740
Now, raise your hands out there if you think that images value go from

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.670
zero to 255.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.200
Come on, be honest, you're raising your hands, okay.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.770
That is a pure accident, zero to one probably would have made a lot more sense.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.420
Zero be black, white be white, oh sorry, one be white.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.900
Where did the 255.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.070
Well, you computer nerds we all know.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.180
Well there are 8 bits in a byte, right.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.010
So if they're all on they're all ones we'll call that 255.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.601
There is nothing special about 255, okay.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.329
And in fact,

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.430
later we're going to even have to have images that can have negatives in them.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.640
So the thing that you just have to remember,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.410
is we're going to allow our images to go from some min to some max.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.710
The min will be sort of the blackest black, the max will be the whitest white,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.820
if we're actually thinking of them as intensities.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.710
But later if we think of them as just pure functions,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.270
like image derivatives, they just going to take on some real value.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.810
By the way, we can do color images the same way.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.690
Now, instead of having one function that maps x,y to an intensity, we just have

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.880
three functions, often called r, g and b, sometimes called l, u and v.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.880
We're going to talk about that way later.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.200
All right? But they basically,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.510
you can think of this as what we call a vector-valued function so

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.070
every pixel, the function is a vector of three numbers.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.620
Like I said, most of the time we'll be sticking to gray level images.
