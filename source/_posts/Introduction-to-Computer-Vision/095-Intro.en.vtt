00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.880
Up until now, we've really been doing really mostly image processing where

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.320
you take an image in, sum of I of x,y and you apply some function to it and

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.310
you get out a new image what I'm labelling is I prime of x,y.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.760
And that's great and there's whole courses, in fact, entire careers.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.470
Hundreds of thousands of PhDs written on image processing.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.020
But that's not why we're here.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.520
We're here to talk about real computer vision.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.492
In real vision you still take an image in, but what you get out is good stuff.

00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:32.980
All right, the whole idea is that we're putting images in and

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.810
we're getting stuff out.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.110
So what are some examples of stuff?

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.080
Well, maybe just a line.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.250
So here we have an image on the left and

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.080
some edge description of it in the middle, and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.860
you can see a whole bunch of lines that have been found within this image.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.250
Or maybe you want to find circles.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.010
Actually it's a little hard to see, but there's a bowling ball there.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.820
And the way the bowling ball was found was find all the circles in the image.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.780
Well guess what?

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.490
There's only one circle and that's the bowling ball.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.360
Or, here's some more circles.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.360
Just find the coins.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.230
And in fact I'll tell you that this particular picture was put

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.170
together by a TI TA of mine a huge number of years ago.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.950
He's now a pretty famous researcher doing stuff on at I can't say where.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.820
But this was in order to show how to do a Hough transform on circles.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.650
And you might even find a good stuff as like.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.630
Find me this car.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.260
So you see on the,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.960
on the left here just some examples of where we might locate the car.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.080
But actually, the car is found right in the middle.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.440
Actually, this is a notion of an arbitrary shape.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.710
And in fact, we're going to get to how to do finding an arbitrary shape.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.370
Actually not this lecture, not this lesson, not the one after it.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.199
But the one after that, where we talk about a generalized Hough transform.
