00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.270
We'll take a minute here to do a little demonstration of

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.550
using a Hough transform that's built into MATLAB.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.760
And I'll repeat, on your problem set, you're going to be doing some Hough code.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.400
And you're not to use the Hough implementation that's already there.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.780
Nor anybody else's Hough implementation that you have from the, from the web.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.830
Because it turns out when you go and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.180
write your Hough implementation certain things are going to break.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.900
And it's in that experience of it breaking that you're going to learn what

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.120
the important elements of it are.
