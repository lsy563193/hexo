00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.500
Welcome back to Intro to Computer Vision!

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.580
The last time we talked about homogenous transforms, and

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.140
said how they were a form of a projective transform.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.830
And we showed for a high chromographies are your best friend.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.720
They allow you to map from one plane to another and to be able to map image

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.390
planes, and that allowed us to do panoramas and other kinds of cool things.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.250
Today what we're going to do

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.320
is we're going to get a little heavier in the projective geometry stuff.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.990
It's actually a short lesson.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.450
And we're doing this for two reasons.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.418
Well three reasons.

00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:33.890
One is no self respecting computer vision person should not

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.740
know something about projective geometry.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.440
So, you can say you know something about projective geometry and

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.710
impress your your parents.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.950
More importantly.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.220
Or, or maybe significant others if you're dating a nerd.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.540
More importantly we're going to use in a little bit when we

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.780
talk about the relationship between multiple views.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.250
Because projector geometry is just a very convenient way

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.900
of representing the projection operator.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.800
Which after all is how images are made.
