00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
&gt;&gt; One thing that comes up when doing filtering is what to do

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.735
about the boundaries,

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:06.879
because you might ask what happens when your filter falls off the edge.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.096
&gt;&gt; What happens when your filter falls off the edge?

00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:12.277
&gt;&gt; Meghan has been rehearsing this all week, outstanding.

00:00:12.277 --> 00:00:16.619
Well, basically it's undefined until you define it.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.258
All right?

00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:21.080
So you have to think about what size operation you want, so

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.422
that can be illustrated like this.

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:24.501
Okay?

00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:27.623
And here we're going to use a little bit of old MatLab nomenclature,

00:00:27.623 --> 00:00:31.432
they've changed it, because the old MatLab nomenclature actually makes it clear.

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:36.460
So, here I've got a function f and I'm filtering it with g.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.256
And you might try to think about well, what's the size output that I want.

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:43.494
And there's sort of three different possible sizes.

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:50.554
One is when g just touches that corner, I start to get a response.

00:00:50.554 --> 00:00:54.095
So if I think of the center point of g as the reference,

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:58.761
I would actually get a box that's bigger than the original function.

00:00:58.761 --> 00:00:59.737
Okay.

00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:05.072
The flip side is if I want to make sure that all of g is actually touching f,

00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:08.657
then I'm going to, again using the center point,

00:01:08.657 --> 00:01:12.252
I end up with a smaller output than the original.

00:01:12.252 --> 00:01:14.639
And that, that's used to be referred to as valid,

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:16.756
since all those points were in fact correct.

00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:20.615
But the problem is when I filter a 55 by 55 image,

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:23.791
I'd really want to get back a 55 by 55.

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:27.356
I don't want to get back a 58 by 58 or a 52 by 52.

00:01:27.356 --> 00:01:30.118
What I want is referred to as the same.

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:35.900
So here you see that we put that filter with its middle at the corners and

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.058
we get back the same size.

00:01:38.058 --> 00:01:40.185
So the problem of course,

00:01:40.185 --> 00:01:45.419
is what's underneath these pixels here that are sticking out?

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:47.147
And basically when you do filtering,

00:01:47.147 --> 00:01:49.310
you have to tell the system what you want there.
