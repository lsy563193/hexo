00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.350
That's still pretty ugly.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.160
We can make that look even nicer.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.960
All right?

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.360
Here is a very simple, beautiful way of writing this.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.650
That this quadratic approximation, so

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.090
quadratic, remember we're just looking at the square terms of the u v.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.640
Right? It can be written matrix form as u v times this matrix M times u v.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.600
This, you know, you could think of this as u v, transpose.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.290
All right, where M is the second moment matrix written down here, okay?

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.920
Again, what is has is it's the weighted sum of the squares and

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.740
of the product of the two different derivatives.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.320
It pays to think a little bit more about this M matrix,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.140
because we're going to do it even more in a minute, all right?

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.770
So, here I've just copied it over, and for a moment, it's kind of a joke.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.130
For you guys that're physics geeks, if I say for the moment and

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.950
we're talking about the second order matrix,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.780
you realize it has something to do with moments of inertia.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.570
Nevermind.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.070
Okay, I'm going to write that M matrix in, without the weights at the bottom.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.980
Okay.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.890
And when I write it that way,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.110
you can see that this is just the sum of ixx, sum of iyy, and the cross sum.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.520
That can just be written as the sum,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.660
this is referred to as an outer product, right?

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.080
So it's the outer product of the single gradient, okay.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.979
That's what this says.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.100
One of these is just the outer product of one vector.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.510
It's a two by two matrix but it's an outer product of one vector.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.690
In linear algebra you realize that's only a rank one matrix, right.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.463
Because let's just take the columns, the columns are just a multiple of Ix Iy.

00:01:39.463 --> 00:01:44.780
And each column is, is a, is a, is a multiple, multiplied by a different scaler.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.310
So when the two columns are scaler multiples of each other,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.590
it's not a full rank matrix.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.785
So its two by two is actually rank one.

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:56.470
Okay, that's what it says here, each is a product of rank one.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.340
And then of course,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.540
this thing is going to be summed over all of the points within the window.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.640
So what's it going to take for this matrix to be full rank, for

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.538
this to be sort of a well-behaved ellipse?

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:13.200
We would actually have to have gradients in different directions over

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.830
the window to be summing up a bunch of different rank one matrices and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.100
that would get us to a full rank.
