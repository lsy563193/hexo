00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.260
Let's revisit our weighted average.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.670
Okay.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.490
So, instead of just thinking about averaging the local pixels,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.890
let's think of this as a set of weights, okay, and what we're going to do is

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.150
we're going to weight all of these pixels by some set of weights, and

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.420
we're going to combine them using those weights to come up with the new value.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.880
Now when we were just doing the moving box, our weights were just,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.730
let's say it was five long, they would be one fifth,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.760
one fifth, one fifth, one fifth, one fifth, five of them, right?

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.800
So our weights was uniformly distributed, okay.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.390
But wait a minute, does that make sense?

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.360
Remember our assumption that nearby pixels are related to my value?

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.090
And there's another related assumption to that.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.770
The more nearby you are, the more related you are.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.660
So that means that pixels that are closer to me

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.840
should contribute more to the average.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.170
So let's change our moving average, so that that's true, okay?

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.660
Before, if you remember, we had these uniform weights.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.500
One, one, one, one, one, all the way across, divided by five.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.740
What if we wanted to use some nonuniform weights?

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.172
So, so here's a set.

00:01:10.172 --> 00:01:13.068
One, four, six, four, one divided by sixteen.

00:01:13.068 --> 00:01:16.863
And what I’m going to do is I’m going to change those weights from

00:01:16.863 --> 00:01:19.210
being uniform to being nonuniform, and

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.470
I want you to watch what happens to this bottom picture.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.310
So that’s the uniform weight,

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.120
and that’s the nonuniform, centered weighted, right.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.845
Uniform.

00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:30.590
Nonuniform.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.740
And you'll notice that the nonuniform is a smoother rendition.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.590
In fact, you know, take a look here.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.106
You know, this area right there, we get a smoother range of, of what's going on.

00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:46.070
And the nonuniform weights corresponds to

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.350
this assumption that the more nearby a pixel is, the more weight it should have.
