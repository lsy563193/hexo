00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.280
And here's an example of it being run in a color image.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.029
What you should see here is that there's this color board in a dark shadow.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.680
Okay? And here's the same color board in bright sunlight.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.290
Right?

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.430
And the idea is that in the image, if you actually measured the intensity coming

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.450
off of this white square, and the intensity coming off of that black square,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.260
you would actually see the values of 119 in both places.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.440
So objectively, those two are the same value.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.070
But of course, you and I both say that this is white and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.490
this is black, even though they have the same value coming to our eye.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.730
Because clearly what's going on is we're saying, oh that's in shadows, so

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.520
I, I recalibrate that.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.070
Well when you run that retinex algorithm that I just showed you,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.810
and by the way, running it in two dimensions is a little bit trickier than

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.300
running it in one dimension.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.340
That it says that this thing has a value of some random number 126.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.510
This thing has a value of 175, so it is figured out, that the white square is

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.910
brighter than the black square, even though in the darkness, the light square's

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.320
going to have the same amount of light as the black square in the sunlight.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.510
Another way of thinking about this is if you take a piece of coal, black coal,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.890
outdoors in the sunlight, and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.690
you look at it, more light is going to be hitting your eye,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.970
coming from that black coal than a white piece of paper, inside your classroom.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.660
Okay?

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.440
And yet the white piece of paper looks white and the black coal looks black.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.440
And that's because your brain is computing for

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.430
all the stuff that's going on around it.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.930
And this, this constancy, and lightness constancy,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.880
we'll talk about it in just a second, is it's just remarkable.
