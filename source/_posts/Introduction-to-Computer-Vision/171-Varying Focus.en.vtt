00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.900
One of the cool things about real lenses is as I'm looking at a scene if I

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.020
want too, I can just change, a little bit the focus in and out.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.050
Now for those of us who use cameras that just take pictures,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.150
our goal is to put something in focus or out of focus et cetera, whatever.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.450
If you're like Meghan,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.170
who thinks static pictures are just like way old school and the only thing that

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.000
matters is video, then the idea of changing focus during video is interesting.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Generates something that's called pulling focus or

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.250
a focus pull, and you get this really cool effect.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.500
And here you can see this picture of this, pretty sure that's the Water Temple

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.680
in San Francisco, somebody else might remember.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.750
And there's the back end, that's of a duck, but

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.120
you can kind of see that it's shot through a fence.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.330
And as I run the video, you can see how changing focus changes where, how far in

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.780
the scene, how far z has to be in order for it be in focus on the image plane.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.500
And that's pretty cool.
