00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.680
Summary slides, I love summary slides.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.651
For 2-views and we learned at the beginning, there's a geometric relationship

00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:13.279
that defines the relation between rays in one view and rays in the other view.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.740
And we were referring to that about the epipolar geometry.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.720
These relations can be captured algebraically besides geometrically.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.540
For the calibrated camera case that was referred to as the essential matrix.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.360
For the uncalibrated camera case, it's the fundamental matrix.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.037
And the math that we've been going through has been talking about how you can

00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:33.140
find these matrices.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.139
How you can find these relations by just giving me

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:40.099
the correspondences between points from one image to the next.

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:41.039
All right.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.200
This ends the lesson on fundamental matrices.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.608
In fact, it ends the entire unit on calibration in stereo.

00:00:47.608 --> 00:00:50.060
I hope you realize that from these relationships,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.120
you can capture the geometry of the scene.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.088
That is given some camera views,

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:58.880
you can eventually figure out the three-dimensional locations of the points.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.939
So this is not image processing, right?

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:04.779
This is actually vision where we recover a 3D structure.

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:08.228
And if you're taking the OMS version of this, of this class and

00:01:08.228 --> 00:01:12.540
you're doing the OMS problem sets, you're going to get to know and love these.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.640
Well, you're going to get to know.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.980
I hope you'll love these processes pretty well.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.020
That's it for this unit.
