00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.669
I've been showing you this in one dimension.

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.490
It extends pretty simply in two dimensions and

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.174
here are the two dimensional forms, okay?

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:10.009
So this f of u, this is just when I've got a,

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.446
a continuous two dimensional function.

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.081
Here we have f of x, y.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:19.451
Well, when we do it in discreet land, f of x, y is now going to be at discreet

00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:24.925
points and we have f of kx, ky, those are the two different frequencies.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:28.863
The fr, the discrete frequency in x, the discrete frequency in y.

00:00:28.863 --> 00:00:31.406
And by the way, this works middle if you put the origin of k in the middle,

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:32.767
you want to put the zero in the middle.

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:36.737
So for minus k k n over 2 to plus n over 2.

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:40.526
Let's take a look at applying this two dimensional discrete Fourier

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:41.776
transform to images.

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:44.549
So remember, we showed you, we talked about that we are going to have

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:47.782
these bases that have horizontal vertical components that can be combined.

00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:50.518
What does that look like when we apply these things to images?

00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:52.920
So let's take a look at some very simple examples.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.554
All right.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:57.264
So here I have a sinusoid and it's at some particular frequency and

00:00:57.264 --> 00:00:59.527
it's only made up of vertical stripes.

00:00:59.527 --> 00:01:04.165
What is the spectrum, the power spectrum of its Fourier transform look like?

00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:07.510
Well, it looks just like this and its a little hard for you to see, but

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.136
there are two bright dots there.

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:12.394
The origin is here in the middle and there is a dot to the left and

00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:13.407
a dot to the right.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:13.974
Okay.

00:01:13.974 --> 00:01:20.481
Those are my spikes for the, the frequency of this particular sinusoid.

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:27.521
So this picture, you see has only horizontal stripes and it varies more quickly.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:31.641
So these dots are now spaced vertically for sinusoid that goes in this

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:36.630
direction and they're further out, because the frequency component is higher.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.935
If I have a sinusoid in an oriented direction, same deal again.

00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:42.470
It's a little hard to see.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.340
We've got these dots that are spread in that direction.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.542
Let's go back to our linearity.

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:51.524
So let's suppose I take the picture on the left and

00:01:51.524 --> 00:01:54.515
the picture in the middle and I sum them together.

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:57.051
And we're actually going to do a sum, so it's linear.

00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:57.818
Right?

00:01:57.818 --> 00:01:59.964
So this picture's going to look like that, so,

00:01:59.964 --> 00:02:02.289
you know, it's some combination of sinusoids.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.138
But remember, a Fourier transfer, Fourier series is just made up of sums and

00:02:07.138 --> 00:02:09.763
multiplies, it's a linear operation.

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:10.631
Okay?

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:17.104
So, the Fourier transform of the sum is just the sum of the Fourier transforms.

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:18.005
Okay?

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.770
So that's why this picture is just these combined.
