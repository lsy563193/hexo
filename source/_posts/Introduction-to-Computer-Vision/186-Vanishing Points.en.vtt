00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.180
These points are called vanishing points.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.870
Here's it demonstrated that each set of parallel lines,

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.460
that means they're all in the same direction, meet at the different point.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.900
Another thing that's true is that parallel lines that are all on the same plane,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.540
they all converge to colinear Vanishing points.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.630
And you know this as the horizon.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.780
So here is one set of parallel lines in the world.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.820
And they converge to a point here.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.630
This is another set of parallel lines.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.520
And they converge to a point there.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.720
If I had parallel lines going away from the camera,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.320
they would converge like this, all right?

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.080
And the horizon is this line right there.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.810
And that's because all of those parallel lines that I drew, they were all

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.360
in ground plane, so they all converge at vanishing points on the horizon.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.290
By the way it turns out

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.260
getting the vanishing points consistent, when you're putting together an image.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.970
Like, you're taking a piece of a building here, and

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.540
putting something else together there,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.520
as opposed to actually taking a picture, is actually kind of hard.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.150
So if you want to try to find a fake image.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.560
That is, something that's been Photoshopped, put together.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.620
Go to your local supermarket tabloid.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.780
You can often find pictures where the vanishing points don't seem to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.110
do the right thing, and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.780
that's because it was made up of parts of an image that weren't taken with

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.860
a camera aligned with those parallel lines all in the same way.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.090
A little bit more, maybe some of you actually took an art class,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.360
before you decided to lose your soul and become an engineer.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.810
And maybe they taught you about 3-point perspective.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.800
Well and here's a drawing of 3-point perspective.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.710
And basically what they're talking about is if I've got a cube in the,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.970
in the, in the air.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.190
That defines three sets of parallel lines.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.420
Like the left face, the right face and then underneath.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.250
And you could see that drawn here and that's where it comes from,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.300
is that parallel lines converge to different Vanishing Points.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.930
Here's another example I think, I think this is a Zisserman product,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.750
I'm not sure, so just a really quaint old building.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.220
And there's Vanishing point from the right, from the power lines there,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.230
another Vanishing point on the left.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.550
And without talking about others,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.840
you can see where the horizon is, okay, right across there,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.070
that's where all the lines for example, on the ground would converge.
