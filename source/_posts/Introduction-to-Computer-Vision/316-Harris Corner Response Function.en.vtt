00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.020
You have to remember something from your linear algebra.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.610
And by the way, I have to look this up every time, so

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.860
if you don't remember, that's okay.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.800
One is that the determinant of a matrix, remember the determinant of a matrix?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.810
That's actually the product of the eigenvalues, okay?

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.750
So lambda one, lambda two,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.830
multiply them together, that's the, that's the determinant.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.370
With two zeroes in there, it's easy to see.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.590
It's a little harder to see in the more general case.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.890
The other thing is that the trace of the matrix, right?

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.080
The sum of the diagonals, is the sum of the Eigenvalues.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.860
So the determinant of a two-by-two is trivial to compute, right?

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.750
This minus that, or however you like to determine some two-by-twos.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.900
Trace is easy, sum them up.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.500
And the Harris operator was just to compute some function R.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.120
You take the M matrix.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.860
You take its determinate, minus some constant of the square of the trace.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.450
And I'll tell you that empirically, the constant was small number, 0.04, 0.06,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.440
written here, exactly how things scale depends a little bit on your, the,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.860
the way you do your gradient operators and pixels.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.540
Okay?

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.250
So it's the determinant, which is a product.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.560
Minus the alpha trace.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.360
So the real equation of what you're looking at is right there.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.990
Okay?

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.700
So taking a look at lambda one lambda two minus alpha one,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.310
alpha times lambda one plus lambda two squared.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.210
Let's think about this.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.160
R depends on the Eigenvalues but we don't actually have to compute them.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.220
And that's great, because even in 1980,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.050
in the 80s you'd want to compute your eigenvalues, maybe, I don't know.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.660
But the idea is that you compute a single number, all right, really fast.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.760
All right.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.440
So, we've already said that R is large for a corner.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.290
And why is that?

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.050
Well, if they're large then both of the l one and l two are large.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.200
Their product is even large and if you take the squares.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.640
You know it's l one square plus l one l two plus l two squared.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.490
Subtract it off.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.520
Yeah but you're subtracting off alpha of it.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.160
It's a small amount.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.490
Okay? So it's still going to be large.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.240
But if only one of the L's is large, then this term goes small,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.390
whereas one of these terms is large so the R value is negative, okay.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.630
So that you can measure the R value, it's negative along an edge, so

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.330
R is large for corner, it's negative, along an edge and if the magnitude

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.970
of R is small, basically that means that everything was small, right?

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.070
So L1 and L2 is, is small, everything there is small.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.160
Well, that's the flat region we were talking about, right?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.520
None of the gradients have any magnitude to speak of.
