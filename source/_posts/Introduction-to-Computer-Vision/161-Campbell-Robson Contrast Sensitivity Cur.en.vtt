00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.190
That almost ends our lesson on frequency.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.170
There's just one more thing that I wanted to talk to you about today,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.930
because it's so prevalent in the processing that you're going to be doing.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.572
Some psycho physicists, Campbell and Robson studied a long time ago

00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:17.990
the contrast sensitivity of the human eye, human vision system not just the eye.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.120
Now what you're looking at here is a curve where frequency goes up

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.570
to the right and contrast goes up down.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.990
And probably, if you're like me, hopefully you're not like me,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.200
one of me is way more than enough, as my children will tell you.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.350
But anyway, if you're like most humans,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.020
you probably can see this stuff really well, but not so much up there.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.010
And somewhere around there, that curve is where the fall off is.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.160
That essentially, you know, lower contrast up here,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.060
you can't really see the variations.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.440
Same thing with this high contrast, okay?

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.520
Your eye is sensitive in different ways.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.810
So what this means is that some frequencies

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.550
matter more in terms of the importance to you in an image, okay.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.460
In particular, if I were to leave out a bunch of that freq,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.210
you know, frequencies.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.760
So that is, if there was low contrast at the high frequency,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.230
you wouldn't even know, so you can use that to do image compression.
