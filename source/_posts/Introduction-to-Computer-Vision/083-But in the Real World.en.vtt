00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.040
So far, so good.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.755
Except that what I just showed you won't work.

00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:06.780
[LAUGH] And let me show you why.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.270
So in the real world.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.720
So here I have this little function, okay?

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.780
And so this is f of x, right?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.460
And it's got some stuff, and then it takes a jump and

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.170
it's got some more stuff over there.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.350
So that's intensity as a function of x.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.080
If I actually take the gradient of that function by just doing,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.350
say, a right difference.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.940
All right?

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.680
What I'll do, I'll apply my derivative operator and I'll get this.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.510
And one might ask, where is the edge.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.830
Well, we can see here, the edge is really, whoops,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.710
I missed, the edge is right there.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.670
But in this mess, it's sort of hard to tell.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.960
And the problem, of course, is that we've added noise.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.570
And that noise has caused us to have positive and

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.690
negative derivatives all over the place.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.360
So let's look a little bit more about the effect of noise on some of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.470
our derivatives and what we might do about them, okay?

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.290
So, here we have again more of that striped duck,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.490
and here we have the gradient image.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.290
And what you can start to see is that as I add noise to the image,

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.580
my gradient starts to fall apart.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.200
That is I'm starting to see this, I had this little bit of Gaussian noise and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.660
now I'm turning into these big salt and pepper noise.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.490
Oh it feels like salt and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.780
pepper noise, just these large spikes are happening within my derivative.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.810
So we have to handle that noise somehow.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.010
You probably know how to handle, how do we handle noise?

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.360
We filter, we smooth, we get rid of it, right?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.460
We did that before.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.200
Come on, are you paying attention?

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.660
Alright, so here's my image f.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.260
So now let me apply a smoothing kernel, h.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.730
Okay, so I'm just going to smooth it.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.820
So when I smooth it, I get this is h convolved.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.780
Doesn't matter whether you do convolution or correlation.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.230
H convolved with f, and you see now I get a nice, smooth function.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.210
So now that we've smoothed the signal, we can take the derivative and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.920
what you see is we get this nice, smooth peak.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.540
So, where is the edge?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.700
The edge is going to be at this peak right here,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.840
corresponding to that edge right there.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.970
So basically in order to find our edges, we're going to have to

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.410
basically apply smooth gradients somehow and look for some peaks.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.110
Before we go ahead and

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.780
do that, remember this whole notion of associate property and linearity etc.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.640
We can save ourselves an operation, because the derivative of h

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.400
convolved with f, is the same as the derivative of h convolved with f.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.540
So what does that look like when we're doing this edge detection?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.800
It's the following.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.770
So here we have the same f that we had before.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.570
Now, I take my h, and I take the derivative.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.210
That now looks like this.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.001
When I apply that function directly to f,

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:47.201
I get out the same value that I got out last time.

00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:51.347
Which has to be because of the associative property of linear operators, and

00:02:51.347 --> 00:02:55.110
derivatives and filtering being these linear operators.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.980
That also saves us an operation, because we can just take this filter and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.840
apply it and no more derivatives have to be done.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.100
All right, so last question, okay.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.820
So, we have these nice peaks.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.030
We have to find the peaks.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.800
We have to find the maximum of that derivative.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.460
How do we find maxima?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.090
We take more derivatives.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.130
So we're going to have to take another derivative.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.920
So now, instead of just doing a single derivative,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.140
we're going to take a second derivative.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.240
So, before h was just a Gaussian, this was our first derivative of a Gaussian.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.680
If we take the derivative of that again we get this,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.780
what's sometimes called inverted mexican hat.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.080
And you'll see that, when we do it in 2D,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.640
right, because it's kind of like this sombrero shape but up and down, right?

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.720
When we apply that operator to the image,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.130
we get this nice zero crossing with this strong slope.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.290
And that's what corresponds to our edge.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.790
All right.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.040
And this idea of a stong slope zero crossing.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.040
We don't have to find general maxima, we just have to find any place where

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.425
the value is zero and that nearby has a strong gradient.
