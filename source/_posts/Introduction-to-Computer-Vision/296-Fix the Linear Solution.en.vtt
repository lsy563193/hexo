00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.750
It's pretty simple to fix that linear solution that we did before.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.939
So do what we said before, solve for F.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.510
And you can do SVD where that minimum eigenvector or you can

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.670
use the linear thing where you set it to 1, although I don't like that method.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.310
Okay, you solve for an F.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.170
Then what you do is you decompose your F using SVD again.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.230
This is another SVD, another singular value decomposition.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.994
And you're going to get out three terms, all right.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:33.405
Remember SVD gives you UVD transpose, V is the lower-dimensional orthogonal

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:37.780
matrix of all unit vectors that are orthogonal with each other.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.130
U is also orthogonal but of the full dimension.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, what did D stand for?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.150
No, not dalmatian, not dysfunctional, despite what you might think.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.350
D stood for diagonal, okay?

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.560
So it breaks down, it gives you a diagonal matrix.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.820
Now if F is really a full ranked three by three matrix,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.750
D is going to come out as a diagonal matrix with three non-zero elements.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.200
And D, normal SVD, is produced in a decreasing magnitude, okay?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.970
So it goes from largest to smallest.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.250
So what we do is, we take the D that comes out,.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.590
And I just wrote that as rst here, okay?

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.950
And t is smaller than s which is smaller than r.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.750
And what we're going to do is we're going to create a new D, D hat.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.700
And just set that less, that least value to 0.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.780
Because it was supposed to be 0,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.180
because that would be a rank 2 F would have a r, s, and 0.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.940
So we make it 0, great.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.860
Once we've done that we can build a new F,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.010
which I'll call F hat, using the same U that we got the first time.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.450
The same V that we got the first time, but

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.060
we substitute in this new D, right, D hat.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.260
Which is the one that has only got two diagonal elements.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.850
And that gives us a new fundamental matrix that has just rank 2.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.050
When I apply that to the example that I showed you before,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.660
you get epipolar lines that look like this.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.080
Way, way better.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.210
In fact, you can see here the camera was not moving perfectly straight.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.010
It was moving off to the side just a little bit in that direction,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.250
and here is the epipole, right?

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.000
All the epipolar lines go right through the epipole, so

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.940
we've got the good F, and all is happy in Oz.
