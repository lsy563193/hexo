00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.140
Let's use this method of selecting a range of rows and

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.300
columns to extract a larger portion from an image.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.620
By the way, this is also known as cropping an image.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.710
Let's use a different picture this time.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.309
Let's see what it looks like.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.460
All right, a classic two-wheeler there.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.154
Let's check the size of the image first.

00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:23.780
All right, 320 by 500.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.700
When cropping this image, we'd want our limits to be within this range.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:37.120
Let's say we want to select rows 110 through 310, and columns 10 through 160.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.190
I wonder what we'll find there.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.020
That's the front wheel.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.820
No points for that.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.950
So what is the size of the cropped image?
