00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.350
So a variety of proposals have been made.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.220
Most famous is by, Edwin Land, actually, and it's called now the Retinex Theory.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.160
He had a variety of, ways of going about this but

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.340
overall the whole process is called the Retinex Theory.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.110
This was Edwin Land, a remarkable inventor.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.470
He was the inventor of the Polaroid Land camera.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.400
So he originally was doing, polarized filters, and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.960
Polaroid the company got started and he was part of that.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.960
And then when, they invented, he invented the instant film it wasn't enough to

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.700
call it the Polaroid Camera, it was actually called the Polaroid Land Camera.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.920
He was incredibly industrious, and har, driven, and driving kind of guy.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.630
He used to give really interesting,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.270
remarkable demonstrations of humans perceiving different lightness, using.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.610
In fact, he had this really cool way, he could show an image of just one color.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.330
Kind of, this pink, with these different squares.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.560
And then a, a greyscale image, of, also, different squares, and overlay them.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.270
And humans would see color.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.750
And it was, it was remarkable.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.160
I had the opportunity to see him,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.640
when I was still a graduate student in Cambridge.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.120
And he's kind of giving this talk, and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.840
then also shows this thing, and these colors appear.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.489
And the whole audience broke out in applause, it was kind of cool.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.250
Anyway, Land, invented, or, or, or put forward a, a variety of what's re, called

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.550
the retinex theory, and I'll give you just the general idea of how that works.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.940
So the goal, is to remove the slowly vary, it's the slow variations in

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.590
the image, and there are a variety of ways of doing it.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.276
One approach, that I'll show you in just a minute.

00:01:23.276 --> 00:01:29.753
Is to, if L is equal to the product of R times E,

00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:34.747
then if I take the log of both sides.

00:01:34.747 --> 00:01:39.220
So, obviously, the log of multiplication is just the sum of the logs, right?

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.220
And then what you're going to do is we're going to, and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.080
I'll show you this in a minute, we're going to hi-pass filter this,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.820
only keep the high frequency.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.470
And then we're going to threshold to remove.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.250
Any of those low frequencies.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.150
And then we're going to invert it to get back the, actual reflectance.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.640
So let me show you what that looks like
