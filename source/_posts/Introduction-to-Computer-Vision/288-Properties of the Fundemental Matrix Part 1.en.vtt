00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.990
All right. If you had actually been here while we were recording this,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.030
you would have seen that I just walked around the room 17 times trying to get my

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.670
act together.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.686
because I started to talk about this and my, my tongue just [SOUND].

00:00:10.686 --> 00:00:13.290
But, but here goes, okay?

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.490
Couple things, all right?

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.160
So, this relationship here,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.620
that's the relationship that happens algebraically between corresponding points.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.970
p and p prime are the image points of the same point outside in the world.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.390
Now, we remember from our epipolar geometry, so like that's over here, that if

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.950
I've got some point let's say it's right here in the image, I know that that's

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.850
on this ray somewhere and therefore that point must be on that epipolar line.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.240
That was the geometric constraint that we had derived earlier.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.960
So the p transpose Fp prime equals 0 is the algebraic one.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.430
The drawings that the epipolar lines is the geometric one.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.500
But clearly, they relate.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.890
So you'll remember from our projective geometry little tutorial that we

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.420
said that the equation of a line, right, could be written a couple ways.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.840
I'm going to write it this way, p transpose l equals 0.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.400
All right?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.750
Remember l was the, that normal to the plane, and all the points p

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.480
had to be on that in that plane, and would be perpendicular to it.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.950
So notice, here we have p transpose, here we have this p transpose,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.630
here we have this l.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.871
Here we have that l, that it here we have that Fp prime, okay?

00:01:31.871 --> 00:01:37.400
These equal 0's align, that's the constraint that has to equal 0.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.556
What this means and that's what's written here is that this l,

00:01:43.556 --> 00:01:50.180
which is Fp prime is actually the epipolar line in the p image, okay.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.971
So remember it's mol, I'm going to to erase this, right?

00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:56.230
It's going to be multiplying a point in the p image.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.910
So l equals Fp prime is the epipolar line in the p

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.530
image associated with the point p prime.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:12.540
Also just reversing this, that means that F transposed p is the epipolar

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.712
line in the prime image, the p prime image associated with the point p.

00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:19.300
All right?

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.070
So what the fundamental matrix does is it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.800
gives us the epipolar line constraint between two views.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.600
So if I know what F is I can compute the epipolar lines.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.530
In fact, you can just for a given point I just take F transpose p and

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.050
that's the epipolar line in the other image.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.110
And that makes sense because the F is what we said deri,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.480
takes all of the, goes through the intrinsics of one,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.320
through the extrinsics, the intrinsics of another.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.950
And so the only thing I don't know for some point that I'm seeing in the,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.830
in my left image is well, since I don't know its depth along that ray, I,

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.060
it has to be along this line, that was the geometry.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.210
So, the fundamental matrix equation reduces that

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.540
geometric constraint to an algebraic one.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.010
The great thing about video's you can go back and take a look at this.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.350
We'll also, in the class notes,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.610
there'll be some pointers to some texts where you can look at it and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.230
learn it from people who are way more articulate than I am.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.840
But that's relationship between the fundamental matrix.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.010
And the epipolar lines.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.420
Go back and look again.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.340
Do it again. Okay, so now you're here and now you're really got it,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.720
you understand it all, so you should really teach this class but I'm stuck here

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.980
on this side of the screen, you're stuck there so I'll keep going, okay?

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.480
Great.
