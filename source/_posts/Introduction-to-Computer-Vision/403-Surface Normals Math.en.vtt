00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.300
So, unfortunately.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.370
Not unfortunately.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.070
Necessarily we have to introduce a little bit of notation and mathematics in

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.600
order to make it easier to understand, what this reflectance map is.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.900
So we're going to start by assuming we have a surface z of x, y.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.230
Right? So here we have z in this direction.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.800
X and y in that direction.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.390
And you have some surface.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.610
As you move in say, the x direction and the y direction.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.280
Your z value changes and

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.990
in fact, you can talk about how z changes as you move an x and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.650
y, that would be the partial derivatives of z with a spec to x and a spec to y.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.480
And we are going to find two variables referred to as p and

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.880
q to represent these derivatives.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.110
Now there is a little bit is ambiguity in the literature.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.090
When I learned it from Burtoll, p was the partial of z with respect to x.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.370
Q is the partial of z with respect to y.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.790
As I was rummaging around the web to see how people talk about this all of

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.900
sudden sometimes people use the negative of the partial of

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.540
z with respect to x and the partial of z respect to y.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.620
And it turns out when you do it as the negative it makes some

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.520
formulations a little bit easier.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.410
So I'm going to use it as the negative, but

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.670
you can use it either way as long as you're consistent.
