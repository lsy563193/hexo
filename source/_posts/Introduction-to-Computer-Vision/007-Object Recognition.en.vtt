00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.620
In sort of a related way,

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.120
there's a lot of technology these days involving object recognition.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.220
So there was this company.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.170
There is this company, Evolution Robotics, that had developed this thing called

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.500
Lane Hawk, which basically prevented some of you.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.490
None of you.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.790
&gt;From putting stuff on the bottom of a basket and

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.130
then wheeling it out and forgetting to mention to the cashier that it was there.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.180
This is actually a huge problem.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.790
And the system, you can see the camera here.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.142
Right, see, that's a camera down here, looking at this.

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:30.722
I wonder if we're going to have to, like, erase that that's a beer.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:31.990
Yeah, you see, now nobody can see.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.400
Okay, you can't tell what that is.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.580
Okay. And it can detect what that is, which is not only pretty cool.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.190
But if you go on their website they'll tell you that five years later,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.460
that product was bought by a different company.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.860
So, there's money to be made in computer vision.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.590
Go do a really cool startup.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.890
Object recognition used to require a lot of computing power.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.810
It's, the computing power has gotten smaller.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.240
And it allows us to now operate in smaller packages.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.390
So, there's this whole area of augmented reality and

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.640
object recognition by mobile devices.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.870
So, here's a system of where you, you're showing it a picture of this statue.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.790
It recognizes who this is and what the monument is.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.690
And here's an old picture from Nokia, where you can actually go off to the web,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.160
pull out information and display it to you.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.150
So for a while we were talking about doing this on smart phones,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.640
now it sits on your face.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.660
This is Professor Thad Starner, a Georgia Tech professor as well.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.710
He was instrumental in the developement of Google Glass.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.640
And one of the things that Glass does is you've got a camera looking out of

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.800
what you're seeing.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.800
And can, through the same object recognition methods,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.810
can give you information about what you're looking at.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.850
And this is also part of computer vision.
