00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.780
So what about images?

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.700
Well images are two dimensional, and doing this in 2D

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.220
is pretty straight forward extension of 1D with a, with a little bit of a flip.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.770
That's going to be a joke.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.990
Alright, so let's do a moving average in 2D.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.650
I hope you can see that there's a whole bunch of zeroes in

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.920
this picture over here.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.920
You see all those zeroes?

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.160
And then in the middle on the bright area are these 90's.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.730
So this maybe is an image that goes from zero to 100, or whatever.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.860
But the idea is that zeroes are dark, and 90's are bright.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.200
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a moving average, so

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.690
here I have my little average right?

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.630
It's a three by three average, and I'm going to take the middle pixel,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.910
over here and I'm going to put that average over there.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.590
Okay?

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.610
So if I put my average overall at zeros and I take an average of all zeros.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.570
I get, Meagan, what's the average of all zeros.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.140
&gt;&gt; Zero.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.980
&gt;&gt; Every now and then I'm going to ask her some questions she has no

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.890
idea what the answer is.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.090
And she's not even sure she's supposed to know the answer, so

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.100
that's kind of cool.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.600
Okay, it's zero.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.050
So now we move our square over one.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.670
Right so we, we move it over here, we get zero, zero, zero,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.560
zero, zero, zero, 90, okay.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.100
What's the average of that going to be?

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.170
Well, you can think of each of these as one ninth, so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.460
one ninth times zero summed up eight times plus 90.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.360
That average is going to be ten.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.950
Okay?

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.580
So it turns ten, and then I slide it over one more, and now I get 290, so

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.850
its average is going to be what?

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.050
20. And keep going.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.590
I get 30, and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.660
keep going further to 30, so I'm just moving this along, replacing the average.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.580
And finally, I get this total averaged value, right?

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.320
And you can see that by putting a three by three,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.790
I get this nice bright area right around here which is

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.680
where my three by three can sit over all the 90 values.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.700
And everywhere else it sort of falls off.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.240
And you'll notice the user zeroes here until we get to these tens.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.380
Where do those 10s come from?

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.130
They come from this one little, bright spot there.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.260
Okay?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.160
And one of the things, by the way, you may have noticed is,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.340
by the boundaries we get these fun, kind of dark values.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.780
And we're going to talk more about, boundary conditions in a minute.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.280
All right.
