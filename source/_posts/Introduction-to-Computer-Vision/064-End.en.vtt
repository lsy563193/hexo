00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.100
So this is the end of the, the lesson.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.190
Mostly what we've just talked about is so

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.020
you understand more about correlation and convolution.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.560
Remember, correlation we take the filter straight, convolution is it's

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.210
the 180 degree rotation so it's both left, right and up and down.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.900
Most of the time if we're using symmetric,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.360
when we're using symmetric filters it doesn't matter.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.590
But if we're taking derivatives, right, so the derivative in the x direction,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.620
there's actually a positive direction versus negative direction.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.500
That's when you do have to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.100
worry a little bit about correlation versus convolution.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.660
And most importantly, filtering is going to be an important tool, sort of, in

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.030
your toolbox for how to deal with images and get out the elements that you need.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.610
And we'll do more of that over the next time.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.370
And then again, much later, when we're trying to compute features over images.
