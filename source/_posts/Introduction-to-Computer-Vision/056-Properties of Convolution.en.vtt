00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.760
All right.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.752
One more thing.

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:05.258
In order for all of this to work, we need a pr-,.

00:00:05.258 --> 00:00:08.530
a, a property called shift invariance.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.130
And shift invariance is basically that your operator behaves

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.800
everywhere the same way.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.200
So I have a couple of pixels over here on the left and I apply my operator.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.720
If I had the same pixels over here on the right.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.640
Oh, this is my left,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.990
my right, your right, turn around, okay, or, look, never mind.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.490
If I have them up and down, right.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.990
If I have a couple pixels up here, and I apply a filter I get the same values if

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.250
I have a couple pixels down here and I apply a filter.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.170
That means that I can shift things around and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.440
do the addition, and get my entire image back.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.332
As we said, because convolution or correlation are built on multiplication and

00:00:42.332 --> 00:00:44.572
addition, these are linear operators,

00:00:44.572 --> 00:00:48.630
making the whole notion of filtering a linear operation.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.350
And this means that convolution has some very useful properties.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.790
For example, it's commutative.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.490
All right. So, f convolved with g is the same as g convolved with f.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.080
Remember that whole idea about which is the impulse and which is the filter?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.540
It's also associative.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.570
So that here we, we wrote the associative property of convolution.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.710
We're going to take advantage of that in just a minute.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.300
It has an, a, a unit impulse.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.020
It's the identity.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.030
So that's what we talk about,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.790
that if you convolve any function with the identity you get back that function.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.850
And then here's a cool one.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.392
Differentiation of course is just the limit of subtraction and then a division,

00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:28.759
and a division is same as multiplication it's 1 over in that, in that case.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.730
So differentiation is a linear operator.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.300
Now you may have remembered that from calculus, right, so the derivative of

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.640
a times f, where a is a constant, was just a times the derivative of f.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.145
And the derivative of f plus g was the derivative of f plus the derivative of g.

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:49.644
So, differentiation is also a linear operator.

00:01:49.644 --> 00:01:54.820
And because of associativity we get this cool property here.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.210
That the derivative of a convolution is the same as taking

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.168
the derivative of one of the elements and then convolving it with the second.

00:02:03.168 --> 00:02:06.440
And we're going to make use of that when we do edge detection and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.169
gradient finding in a little bit.
