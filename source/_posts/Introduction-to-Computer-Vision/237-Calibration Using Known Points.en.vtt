00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.080
Fundamentally at the heart of calibration is this idea of

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.820
having some points whose three dimensional location in the world we know,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.280
and that we identify them in an image.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.880
That is, we can find the correspondence between this point in

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.640
the image is that point in the world.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.320
And then we have to compute some sort of a mapping from a, a scene to the image.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.848
And one thing you can do is you can actually put an object like this in

00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:27.061
the scene that has a bunch of points on it.

00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.005
And you've measured or you know something about the shape of that object and

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.689
you know where all the points are.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.548
Another way of doing it is to make use of, I mean, it's sort of the same math,

00:00:37.548 --> 00:00:40.020
but it's typically referred to as Resectioning.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.461
Which I'm pretty sure is a term that came from photogrammetry,

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:47.155
which is a science that predates computer vision by about a century,

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:51.169
that talked about going between images and three dimensional world,

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:55.310
typically used for mapping, cartography, and stuff like that.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.710
So in Resectioning which is what we're going to do here.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.590
The basic idea is we're going to have some known points.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.530
So on the right here we have a picture of one of our labs.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.990
And one of the times one of my colleagues was using a theodolite.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.412
That's the thing that surveyors use in order to measure things out,

00:01:12.412 --> 00:01:14.690
you know, for property or houses.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.650
And we set up the theodolite in the lab and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.450
we established a world coordinate system.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.329
And you'll notice we put down these markers.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.980
These are actually sort of printouts of what surveyor marks look like.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.050
And what we did was we measured the three dimensional location in the world,

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.920
with respect to this coordinate system, of those points, all right?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.590
So what that does is that's going to give us a set of points, X, Y, Z.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.850
And then of course, given an image like this one,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.760
we can find the location of uv in that image.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.580
Notice again that I'm using the homogenous version of the points.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.380
Here I'm calling it w.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.370
So this is w, u scaled by w v scaled by w, and that's w.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.830
And this was that original equation.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.510
So clearly, given enough points in the world and

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.710
the image, I should be able to calibrate, recover the calibration matrix.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.310
And here's how.
