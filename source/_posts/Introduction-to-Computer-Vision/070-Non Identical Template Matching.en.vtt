00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.009
And in fact that's shown here.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:02.760
So it says, you know,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.090
what if the template in the scene is not identical to some sub image.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.135
So here we have a scene and we have a template, well it turns out

00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:16.777
that the best location of this template in this scene is right there.

00:00:16.777 --> 00:00:18.112
It actually finds the same car.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:20.071
Now you have to worry about scale and orientation and

00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:22.757
all that stuff, stuff that we're going to talk about later in the class.

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:26.462
But even though the cars are quite different the fact of the matter is

00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:29.780
it has sort of bright stuff here and dark brown things there.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.182
This has bright stuff there and dark brown things there.

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:34.854
So as a template it's not awful.

00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:37.330
So that's using these filters as templates
