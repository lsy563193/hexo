Welcome back to Introduction of Computer Vision.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.770
Today we're going to wrap up our unit on essentially calibration and

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.730
stereo and we're going to talk about the fundamental matrix.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.100
Last time, we developed the relationship between two views of two calibrated

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.840
cameras where I actually knew the rotation and translation between them.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.110
And what was cool is we derived, we essentially went with what the geometric

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.620
constraint was that whole epi-polar constraint that we had shown very early on.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.460
And we derived from the geometric constraint, an algebraic constraint.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.590
And in particular we defined something called the essential matrix which related

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.970
between two views or I should say, world points of two calibrated cameras.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.030
So the same point in the scene, the two different views of it,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.590
what the relationship was between them.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.322
But you might ask, suppose I don't have a calibrated camera.

00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:57.090
All right, well look, let's think about the intuition.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.550
If you gave me two images, and

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.290
you gave me enough points to tell me that this point is this one,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.580
this one, this one, this one, gave me enough corresponding pairs.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.720
It feels like you should be able to figure out,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.170
say the epipolar lines, that is how the, how the lines map across and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.730
what the, what the correspondence should be for all the other points.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.910
When I say correspondence, where,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.370
where they can be along the epipolar line depending upon their depth.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.650
Well, today what we're going to do is we're going to make that intuition real.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.795
We'll, we'll do the mathematics of this relationship between two

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:28.840
uncalibrated points.
