00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.510
So here we're going to show you some example of disparity, okay?

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.870
In the left hand side, you'll see,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.680
that there is a point, at the bottom of this window, okay?

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.170
And in this image on the right over here, and by the way,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.240
it took me a while to figure out which image was left and

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.400
which image was right, and I did that by looking right up here at the trees.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.890
You can see that, in the image on the right, that the chimney has moved to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.970
the left with respect to the tree behind it, so that's the right image.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.940
What happened is, if I go to the same location in this image as in

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.770
the first image, I don't land on the window.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.600
I actually have to move this far, in order to get to that window point.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.770
That's the disparity.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.720
And in fact, you can build what's called a disparity map, for every point x, y,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.340
you can say what's the disparity.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.720
And you'll notice something about this disparity image,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.630
right, notice that the stuff here is brighter than the stuff there.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.890
Well, I just made an image of disparity, and remember, disparity is

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.850
inversely proportional to depth, so the brighter values are the closer zs.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.380
All right.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.050
And the smaller values are further away, and, the really small values,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.830
which are very dark, are going to be further away yet.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.530
Okay, and that's this notion of, from disparity being able to get to depth.
