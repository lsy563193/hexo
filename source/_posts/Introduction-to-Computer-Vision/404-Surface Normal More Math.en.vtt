00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.290
So, let's assume we have some sort of a surface normal, okay?

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.990
So, here we have our surface normal drawn and it is on a surface, okay?

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.360
If we have a point on a surface, we can define two tangents, all right?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.570
One is, if I take a step just in the x direction, there's a question of,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.970
how does z change?

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.625
So, if I step in the x direction, no change in y.

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:26.900
Then my change in z will just be the partial z with respect to x.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.570
And so that's negative p.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.920
So tangent in the x direction.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.270
So it's on the surface, let's draw ourselves a little surface here.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.000
Put a point here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And this is one tangent vector, okay?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.370
Well the other tangent vector we can have is we just take a step headed in

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.380
the y direction then there's how the z changes as a function of y.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.410
And that's negative q.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.990
And so that would be another tangent.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.550
So if I want to find the surface normal, that's easy to do.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.610
I just take the cross product of those two directions.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.880
By the way, these vectors they're not,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.530
I haven't made them unit vectors or anything.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.790
They're just taking one, a step that goes 1 in the x direction and

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.160
changes however much it does in z, same thing for the y.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.690
So if I want a unit normal, what I have to do is I have take tx cross ty.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.790
So I, remember, the cross product of two,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.960
two vectors is perpendicular to that right?

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.260
So I take tx cross ty.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.050
And if I want it to be a unit vector, I have to normalize it by the magnitude.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.760
Okay?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.350
And so, when you take tx cross ty, you get pq1.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.530
And the magnitude of that,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.870
of cour, course, is the square root of p squared plus q squared plus 1.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.100
By the way, so the reason I used the minus partial respect to z.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.990
Respect to x and y.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.110
Is, that allows my normal to be p,q, 1.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.670
If I do it the other way, it would be minus p, minus q, 1.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.240
So, same difference.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.550
So that's the algebraic description of p and q.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.770
And that's important, because we're going to use it.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.330
But it's also important to understand the geometric interpretation.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.620
Because when we reason about multiple constraints,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.450
it'll be easier to think about that.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.100
To do that, I have to introduce something called the Gaussian Sphere.
