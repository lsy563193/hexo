00:00:00.168 --> 00:00:02.270
Another area that you know,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.420
really blossomed lately is the use of computer vision for automotive.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.070
This is a,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.080
a website, web picture taken from Mobileye, which is a company out of Israel.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.620
And they've developed all sorts of technologies that use computer vision that

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.780
are relevant to automobiles.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.670
Everything from automatically recognizing signs to,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.870
here it's a little hard to see, red outline.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.360
The system is automatically identifying where the pedestrians are.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.040
They have a system that alerts you if pedestrians getting close and

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.710
you're, seem to be going too fast.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.310
You can also build systems that either brake or slow down or whatever.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.004
But the idea is that computer vision has really gotten into smart cars.

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:39.900
And in fact, smart cars are here.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.750
So this car, some of you know, that is Stanley.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.590
Stanley was the Stanford.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.230
That's the little red S there.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.370
Entry into the Urban Grand Challenge run by DARPA.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.100
And it was started by.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.630
Stanley was run by this guy.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.890
What's his name?

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.080
Oh yeah, Thrun something, I don't know Sebastian.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.140
He's the guy who also started Udacity.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.910
He's sort of a way under achieving, no ambition kind of guy.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.432
They won that.

00:01:04.432 --> 00:01:07.853
And then Sebastian, because he's just out there,

00:01:07.853 --> 00:01:12.607
convinced Google to get involved in the making the automobile process.

00:01:12.607 --> 00:01:14.940
The self driving car, which most of you have heard about.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.250
Here's a picture of it out on the highway.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.130
And the real mark that these things are here today is.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.310
States now have starting passing legislation that helps detail, well who's at

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.280
fault if an accident happens on a particular road and it's a self driving car.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.380
So this is where technology starts to hit policy and economics, and

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.430
that's when you know it's real.
