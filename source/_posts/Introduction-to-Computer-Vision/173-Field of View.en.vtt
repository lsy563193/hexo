00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.610
Another property of our imaging systems is field of view, sometimes called zoom,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.400
which is probably not quite right.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.330
But it's this idea of how wide of a view do we have.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.620
And I'm going to show you this in a lens that can change its focal length to

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.210
show you that the field of view is a function of the focal length.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.300
There are lenses that can change their field of view while staying in

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.140
constant focus are called zoom lenses.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.460
There are some lenses that you can change their focal length but

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.220
you have to refocus.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.590
Those are actually called variable focal length lenses.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.320
That's the, just the nomenclature.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.950
Here we start off with a very wide angle shot, it says 17 millimeters.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.390
And you see this little circle up there that's, that's on that boat?

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.580
As we step through and we increase from 17 millimeter to 28, to 50,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.890
to 85, what we're doing is we're increasing the focal length of the lens.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.690
Here we are at 135, 300, 500, and that's 1,000 millimeters.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.150
So we've gone from a focal length of 17 millimeters to 1,000 millimeters,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.160
it's a ratio of greater than 50 to 1, and there's that guy on the boat, right.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.190
Same boat back here, all right.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.844
There he is.

00:01:08.844 --> 00:01:10.930
Okay, so that's incredible zooming.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.100
So you think they used a tripod?

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.210
Well of course they did, right?

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.640
In fact, this is something you might think about if you haven't thought, right?

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.540
Let's assume for a moment that your hands shake just a little and

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.670
they cause a small amount of angular deflection.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.180
Well if my image is looking at something this wide,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.850
then a small amount of angular deflection doesn't move my pixels very much.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.580
But suppose my angle of view is, you know, a degree or just a couple degrees.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.190
Well, then a small amount of of angular shift of

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.230
my hands is going to move the pixels a lot.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.240
And that's why the longer the focal length,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.200
the more you have to stabilize your image.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.620
And that's why for really nice zoomed out lenses you have to have a tripod.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.170
It's not just because they're heavy.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.130
It's because you need to have things be perfectly still.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.110
Now we can compute the field of view.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.430
And the field of view actually depends upon two things.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.920
One we already know, right?

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.850
We know that it depends upon the focal length.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.050
But it's also going to be a function of, sort of,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.560
how big is the light sensitive element?

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.370
So here calling d the size of the retina, okay?

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.320
So the retina is the thing in the back of your eye that senses light.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.810
Just think of it as the light sensitive medium.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.200
So, so d is this whole size, okay.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.980
Here's f r focal length, and clearly sort of half of d over f,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.780
well, the angle who's the arctan of that, the angle that that's the tangent,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.420
that's going to be this angle phi here, which is half the field of view.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.050
So basically, the bottom line is, the longer the focal length,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.780
the smaller the field of view.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.880
The bigger the, the imaging surface, the bigger the, the field of view.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.420
In fact what's sometimes called medium format photography, instead of using tiny

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.700
little sensors, they use much bigger sensors so they can put, still a lot of

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.120
pixels, but over a much bigger area, that gives it much wider fields of view.
