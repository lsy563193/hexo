00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.490
Now life gets uglier, rotation.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.490
What I have here is a figure, or I think this is also from four-side composite

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.310
slides, and what I'm showing you is two coordinate frames, A and B.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.570
And you'll notice that A has an I vector, a J vector and a K vector.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.490
And B has an I vector, a J vector, and a K vector.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.570
And one of the important things to realize is that this P value,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.410
the vector from the origin, is, can be expressed in two ways.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.210
It can be expressed as some components in the a frame times the x, y,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.550
z components, or some components in

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.320
the B frame with the components in the x, y, and z frame, right?

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.980
They're the same vector, right?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.450
And what's key is understanding that there are these basis vectors and

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.640
we need to know the amount of component that multiples each of them.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.700
What we want to be able to do is say we're going to rotate the frame from A to

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.350
B, and that's what this says.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:10.360
What this says is given my point described in A, I'm going to have a rotation

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.870
operator that would give me the P now expressed in the B frame.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.388
And R A to B means describing frame A in the coordinate system of B and it says,

00:01:21.388 --> 00:01:26.473
so if you gave me the location of a point in terms of the components of A,

00:01:26.473 --> 00:01:30.524
this is and it's only a rotation after applying R,

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:33.490
I get the components in the frame B.
