00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.780
Copying that over.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.360
Well, this is just matrix multiplication.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.670
I hope you all know that a b bracket transpose is just b transpose a transpose.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.070
If not, trust me, all right?

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.130
So I can regroup using the associative property here.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.960
Such that here I have the transpose and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.640
that's where this comes from, from, from that.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.530
Okay.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.036
And then what I can do is I can combine this whole thing,

00:00:31.036 --> 00:00:36.667
the K inverse intrinsics from the right transpose times

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:41.479
Z times K inverse of the intrinsics on the left.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:45.170
Remember I don't know what they are but I just know that they exist.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.510
And I'm going to call that whole thing F.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.940
And when I do that I end up with this beautiful, beautiful, beautiful equation.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.840
It just says that p transpose of the image point on the right,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.690
'kay, so this is from the image now, times F

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.546
times p in the image on the left equals zero.

00:01:10.546 --> 00:01:11.440
Okay?

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.870
And this is a relationship between image points, which I can just write

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.920
this way a p transpose F p prime equals zero.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.240
P being in one frame, p prime being in the other frame.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.500
That is the fundamental matrix constraint.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.580
That's what's going to allow us to solve for the relationship

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.850
between one view and another given enough points that correspond.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.000
Enough p and p primes that correspond, we're going to be able to solve for F.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.070
And once we do that we know what relates the two images, or

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.470
this can just be written as p transpose F p prime equals 0.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.220
P in one frame,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.079
p prime in the other frame it's the relationship between the points.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.070
Now, with this equation, I'm going to be able to do a lot of things.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.480
In a minute, I'm going to show you how we can solve for F.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.670
That is, if you give me enough points p and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.280
p prime that correspond, I'll be able to solve for F.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.810
But the other thing is F is actually very powerful in terms of

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.360
describing how the epipolar geometry works.
