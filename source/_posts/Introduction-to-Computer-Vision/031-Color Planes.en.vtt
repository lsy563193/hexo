00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.471
How about we look at a color image?

00:00:02.471 --> 00:00:05.008
What do you think is the size of this image?

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:06.575
Let's find out.

00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:10.144
258, 320, and 3.

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:12.270
Why are there three numbers?

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.380
The first two are the height and width.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.600
The third one is a number of color planes or

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.510
channels in the image, which is three.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.960
So how would you select a single color plane?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.040
We'll use the same indexing notation we used to crop an image.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.420
Say we want to select the red channel, which is at index one.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.870
We want all the rows, all the columns, but only the first plane.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.050
Now what does this look like?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.220
All right.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.830
So that's what the red channel looks like.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.130
Brighter areas indicate higher red values and darker areas vice versa.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.620
The apples are not as bright as you'd expect.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.710
Why do you think that is?

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.440
Let's also figure out the size of this color channel.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.459
As expected, the width and height of the color channel are the same as

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.370
the original image, but it doesn't have a third dimension.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.250
Well, that makes sense, doesn't it?

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.460
This color plane is one of three,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.620
which are stacked together to create the color image.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.070
Each one of them is a two-dimensional array.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.370
Note that the extracted color channel is an image by itself, so

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.610
you can apply the same operations as you've seen before.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.037
Let's try plotting the values from a row of the image.

00:01:30.037 --> 00:01:34.090
And that's what the plot looks like.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.210
Play with this image in the code editor,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.960
try out different operations, try selecting other colored channels.
