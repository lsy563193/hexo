00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.220
So, m equals Vy is the last column.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.039
And, here's something, just because of what we said before,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.670
these singular values of A, that's d, well the singular values of

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.230
A are the square roots of the eigenvalues of A transpose A,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.960
and the columns of V are the eigenvector of A transpose A.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.580
So, I could show you this, it's actually pretty, well, I was going to say but

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.833
you know, if I just write out this,

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:37.820
since A is we know is written to UDV, transpose.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.700
Okay.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:47.290
A transpose A, is just that transpose, so that's VD transpose U transpose.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.480
Well, okay, U is an orthogonal vector, so

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.770
U transpose is also U inverse, so that's an identity, okay, so that goes away.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.650
D transpose D, well D is a diagonal matrix, so D transpose D is just, I'll,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.350
I'm just going to call it D squared, it's just the squared values, okay?

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.825
And V transpose V.

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:14.010
So, I'm just, so I'm just going to write that A transpose A is equal to VD

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.300
squared V transpose, and that is the equation of the eigen-decomposition,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.180
where V is the, eigenvectors of A transpose A.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.620
And by pulling out the very last one,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.590
I'm pulling out the eigenvector with the smallest value of A transpose A.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.470
Just to recap.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.500
Given that, what we have is Am equal 0 for some long A, what we do is we find

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.570
the eigenvector of A transpose A with the smallest eigenvalue, and that's our m.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.700
That is the set of values that create the calibration matrix for us.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.200
Cool.
