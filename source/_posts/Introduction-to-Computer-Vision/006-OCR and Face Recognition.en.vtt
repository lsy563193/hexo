00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.240
Interesting question is sort of what is the state of the art

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.100
in computer vision now?

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.490
What are things that are people doing with computer vision?

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.510
How might that compare a little bit to the way humans do vision?

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.070
Here is a, a simple example of stuff that, fact used to be sort of considered to

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.110
be difficult, but is actually now pretty standard.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.620
So let's talk about simple optical character recognition.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.160
So here's an example from some license plate readers.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.240
And license plates are somewhat easier because there's a fixed font.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.520
In fact, not that long ago doing OCR was considered very hard.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.302
Today if you have a scanner, or

00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:35.469
if you have Adobe Acrobat, it comes with OCR built in.

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.850
Because that's how ubiquitous and sort of easy it is.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.301
A little more challenging,

00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.510
many of you may have started using automated teller machines.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.481
Where you can deposit bank checks with hand written numbers that are the amount.

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:52.206
And also, for quite a while the Post Office has been recognizing the ZIP

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:54.310
codes using, machines.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.290
Again, on handwritten envelopes.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.570
So that's an example of computer vision extracting the meaning.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.690
What are the numbers that are there?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.950
Another thing that's very common these days is face detection.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.480
Just about any digital camera that you buy today, you pick it up,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.140
using the default setting, it will find the faces.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.600
So, here's an example.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.210
One of the cool things, by the way, is bunch of lectures in the future,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.290
we'll talk about the technology that basically does exactly this.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.910
So the next time, so when we get to those, you pick up a camera and

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.180
it finds the faces.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.970
You'll say, oh, I know how they're doing that.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.210
But actually now, cameras can do more.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.210
I think the one on the left, I think is from the web,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.170
from Fiji, that if you take a picture of somebody, and they blink.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.930
You know, and that can be really annoying, it'll tell you they blinked.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.860
Maybe even more interestingly, Sony has something called the Smile Shutter,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.210
which will watch for people.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.820
And you sort of press it, and say, take a picture now.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.320
But actually it waits until you, it sees the person smile.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.650
And even further these days, there are cameras that will recognize who you are.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.380
So this is a screen taken from a shot where it does camera based login.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.530
So it knows about a bunch of different people.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.521
You walk up to the computer, you say, yo, computer it's me.

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:03.210
Actually you don't have to say anything, and the computer says, it's you.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.210
And it logs you in.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.840
So that's face recognition.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.880
We're going to talk also, a little bit, about face recognition.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.699
Although the face detection stuff techno,

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.880
that technology is one that will be sort of more fundamental to the class.
