00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.819
What else can we do?

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:08.130
Well, if I can warp between planes, arbitrary planes,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.070
that means that I can take planes that, say, are in some particular orientation,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.500
and think about what would they look like turned in a different orientation.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.290
So here we have a si, a situation where we've got a plane,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.185
that's the side of this building, I'm assuming the building is more or

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:26.150
less planar, and I'd like to rectify that.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.880
That is, I want to remove the slant.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.890
So you see this window here.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.260
All right, you see how if I were to extend out, these are vanishing point lines.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.960
All right, so these are not parallel, they're going to converge,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.610
you can see that here.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.300
They'll converge all the way out there.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.140
All right, but if they were,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.290
if it was frontal parallel, then they would remain as parallel lines.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.060
Well, if we could compute the relationship between this quadrilateral,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.430
which is essentially like a trapezoid, between that and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.290
a rectangle, we would be able to rectify the entire building.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.430
And in fact that would look like this.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.370
At which point you're supposed to say, ooh, that's cool.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280
&gt;&gt; Ooh, that's cool.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.040
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.220
So here's the corrected image where now everything is rectilinear.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.060
And in fact, if you take a look at these windows.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.980
In fact notice that these are sort of narrow windows here, and

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.490
wide windows here, and narrow windows there.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.190
If you want to think about that from a measurement perspective,

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.330
you can see that the, the windows that are sort of

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.210
two panes wide were narrower than the ones that are three panes wide.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.100
Even though clearly this is wider than this in the image, but

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.940
when I rectified it I was able to measure the whole thing.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.850
Show you another example of that.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.370
So here's a picture.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.145
Suppose you want to measure something, let's say you start with on the floor,

00:01:40.145 --> 00:01:43.890
okay, so something about across what's on the floor.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.730
Well, so they have tiles, and those tiles are actually rectangles.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.820
So I could unwarp this picture so that those tiles are now squares.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.360
Because they're,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.180
let's say nine by nine inch squares, which is some number of centimeters.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.290
9 times 2.54, it's 18 to 4 and a-half, I don't know, 23, 24 centimeters?

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.190
Anyway, I can rectify that image and then I can go ahead and

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.860
I can measure in that new image directly about the tiles.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.350
likewise, if I wanted to measure something on the side of this wall, and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.880
that's a planar surface also.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.470
It happens to be very skewed.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.660
I could rectify that.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.360
And here, I've taken that wall, and

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.450
I've spread it back out to being rectangular.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.630
Actually, I didn't, the person I stole the slide from did.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.240
And I can now measure on that.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.840
And what kind of warp is this?

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.340
What kind of transformation?

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.510
Plane to a plane.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.390
That's right, it's your friend, the homography.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.200
Just to show you what I was talking about from not from quadrilaterals to

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.830
rectangles, here on the left hand side I've identified four points.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.250
And you can see those four points are the four corners of a two by

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.940
two tile matrix.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.120
But of course, the points aren't rectangular because of

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.020
perspective foreshortening, right?

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.620
But I can warp that to being a regular square or rectangle.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.700
And the rest of the image will come along for the ride.
