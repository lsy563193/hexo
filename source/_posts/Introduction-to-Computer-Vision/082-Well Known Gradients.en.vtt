00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.750
There are lots of well known edge operators.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.070
There's the so, Sobel.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.790
Then Prewitt and Roberts which you can see does these different kinds of ways.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.620
Matlab basically understands all of these.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.230
And in fact, in Matlab there's this cool little function now called fspecial,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.030
which will make filters for you depending upon the name that's in,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.300
might be in the imfilter toolbox only or, or basic Matlab.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.780
But the idea is that you can give it Gaussian, you can give it thing,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.900
you can give it Sobel.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.340
And if you give it Sobel,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.040
what it'll do is it will reply back this operator, okay?

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.470
And in this case, by the way, turn everything into doubles in Matlab,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.850
if I apply that to some image, all right?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.280
So here's the double of my image,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.060
I apply the filter, and then I display it, and I use a gray color map.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.320
And you can see it gives me that gradient image, okay, and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.540
that's the y gradient only.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.000
It also will give you back the x gradient.
