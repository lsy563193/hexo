00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.730
Now let's consider the case where we have parallel image planes.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.630
It's a little hard to see here in the picture, but

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.650
the idea is that I've got two image planes.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.190
My centers of projection are sort of out here.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.050
And any point defines a plane that intersects these image planes.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.500
And it's kind of, it's what's called actually a pencil of planes.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.560
These planes rotate around that base line.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.900
But we have parallel image planes.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.720
What do the epipolar lines look like?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.400
Well, they look like this.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.420
In this particular case,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.500
because of how they're shift, they're these horizontal lines.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.500
And can see that for

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000
the corresponding three points located on that chapel, they land.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.120
Four points, sorry.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.180
That they land somewhere on these epipolar lines.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.040
So if the epipolar lines are all supposed to intersect at the epipoles.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.270
And here, we've got these horizontal epipolar lines.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.020
Where are the epipoles?

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.620
Well as somebody once explained to you somewhere in some metaphysical space,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.530
sometimes various hallucinogens were involved it,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.050
powerful lines intersected infinity.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.070
Okay, so essentially he epipoles are out at infinity.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.220
And if, if you're not sure about that travel to the Himalayas and

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.720
ask somebody high up on a mountain or just high up anywhere.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.810
I don't know if I'm allowed to say that.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.320
Just ask them about parallel lines.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.170
And the idea is that parallel lines here are essentially at infinity.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.910
One way of thinking about that is, as the two planes get closer and

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.630
closer to being parallel, the epipoles keep moving further and further.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.980
And so when you take a limit, when they actually become parallel,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.350
then the location of the epipole is at infinity.
