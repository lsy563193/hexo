00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.030
So what I just told you is referred to as the direct linear calibration or

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.490
transform or transformation method.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.250
It has a couple of advantages.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.470
One is, it's pretty simple to formulate and to solve.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.230
Like I said, it's literally, you just take your points, and

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.146
you make that a matrix.

00:00:17.146 --> 00:00:18.782
You then do some SVD.

00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:20.730
You pull out the column.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.730
Bang, there's your m.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.310
Now these methods are referred to as minimizing an algebraic error

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.210
because essentially what we did was we set a m.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.280
We fixed m to be a unit vector and then algebraically forced found the m

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.510
that gave us the smallest algebraic magnitude of a m.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.100
There are some disadvantages to this method.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.350
First is that it doesn't directly tell you about the camera parameters.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.500
But we'll get, we'll fix some of that in just a minute.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.460
It's also approximate because that m was based

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.730
upon a particular matrix based upon pure extrinsic and intrinsic projection.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.820
What if we had something like radial distortion that we could actually model,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.560
but we couldn't model within our projective transform equation.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.150
How would we do that?

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.020
Suppose I actually knew the focal length, right?

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.174
I went out and bought a really expensive lens with focal length 3.746586,

00:01:17.174 --> 00:01:19.880
really precise millimeters.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.450
I don't want my m screwing with that.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.100
It needs to stay that value.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.810
I want to come up with the minimum solution using that precise value.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.130
And then finally, another problem,

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.690
I put down mostly, I think it's just another one of those problems.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.050
It's not actually minimizing the thing that I really want minimized.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.030
It's minimized this kind of cute algebraic trick that I had.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.180
So, what is it that I actually want to minimize?

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.170
Clearly, the amount of weight I put on every holiday.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.440
But besides that, what?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.840
Okay, that was not even a funny joke, but

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.660
it, it was going too long without any jokes.
