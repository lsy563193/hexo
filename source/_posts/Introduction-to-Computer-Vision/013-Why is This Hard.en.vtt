00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.140
Look.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.100
You opened your eyes sometime, you know, when you were really, really small.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.400
kind of fuzzy for a while.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.480
But after a while, you just saw.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.060
So you might wonder, you know, why is this hard?

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.060
Let me give you a couple of examples.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.010
So here we have a, what you think of as a simple scene, and

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.085
this was generated by Ted Adelson up at MIT.

00:00:21.085 --> 00:00:21.650
Allright?

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.950
And you see on this screen, we've got this checker board here.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.032
And we've got this cylinder casting a shadow.

00:00:28.032 --> 00:00:28.880
All right?

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.700
And there are light and dark squares.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.680
And you see these two squares, the A square and the B square?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.070
Which of those two squares do you think is actually darker?

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.780
Okay. Well if you're like me you say, well duh, it's the A square.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.920
Okay that's, the A is dark, and B is light.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.600
Maybe not so fast.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.190
All right?

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.130
So here I have a gray bar, and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.100
this gray bar is the same intensity all the way down.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.380
And through the magic of Powerpoint,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.066
we're going to slide that grey bar over, and now we have a problem.

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:03.170
There's no edge here, there's no edge there.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.480
That's a constant grey bar, right?

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.730
That means squares A and B are actually the same color on this screen.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.210
Really. In fact if I put two of those bars there,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.770
you start to be able to see it.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.020
Let me go back and forth there.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.870
Do you see that?

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.925
When there is only one bar,

00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:22.130
your brain just wants you to believe that that is a checkerboard.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.980
And that it, the cast shadow, and that that's the light square.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.590
If you actually took a photometer and you measured, you would see that are as

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.380
many photons coming off of this region, as off of that region.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.590
But the photometer doesn't have your brain.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.360
It doesn't understand.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.442
No, no. no, no, that's actually a light square in a cast shadow.

00:01:40.442 --> 00:01:42.120
All right?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.030
This is why computer vision is hard.
