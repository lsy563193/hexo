00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.880
One quick note.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.380
If, instead of doing this in black and

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.690
white, you were actually doing this in
red, green, blue, in a colored version,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.820
right, you would now have, instead of
25 equations, you'd have how many?

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.170
You'd have 75 equations,
five times five times three.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.520
Now, if you're really shrewd,
you might say wait a minute, wait,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.870
wait, suppose my window
was only a single pixel.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.680
You told me professor Bobbitt
that we had this problem, okay?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.540
That we had one equation and
two unknowns.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.500
But with R, G and B I now have
three equations, and two unknowns.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.260
Can't I solve it?

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.070
&gt;&gt; Well, no Frodo,
you can not, all right?

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.340
The problem is is that the R,
G and B images,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.900
you can just think of the image planes,
are quite correlated, okay?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.110
So, you know,
you have a change of intensity but

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.160
you had the same changes of intensity
because of the edge of my shirt,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.340
both in the green and in,
and in the blue channels.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.370
Now one might get brighter and

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.560
one might get darker but the gradients
will be in the same direction.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.760
So the gradients are very correlated, so

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.380
you can't just use the different
color planes in order to solve it.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.230
Good try though, sort of.
