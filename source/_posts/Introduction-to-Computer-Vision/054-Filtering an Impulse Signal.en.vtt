00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.920
So, let's take a look at what an impulse response looks like in an image.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.300
So here we have an impulse.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.310
Okay, and so, here's our impulse, right?

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.960
It's just a single pixel with a value of one, okay?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.830
And we're going to filter it with some kernel, h, okay?

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.570
Remember kernel mask,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.390
thing that we're moving around in order to make our filter, so we have our H.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.360
So the question is, what is the output?

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.600
And again, I want to thank Christin Gramen for having made these slides so

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.780
I can change them, steal them, move them around.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.410
So first I put down my filter, and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.730
you see my filter's over here like this, right?

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.940
So it doesn't hit that 1 at all, and so its value is just going to be a 0.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.410
Fine, no big deal.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.920
All right.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.580
Now, move the filter over a little bit.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.221
Well, it just pulls out the f here, right, so this

00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:52.003
pixel right there pulls out the f so an f goes right there, in, in my result.

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:56.322
Move it over one more time, what do I get, I get the e.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:59.530
Move it over one more time again, what do I get, I get the d.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.520
So, you notice that even though the filter goes D-E-F, left to right.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.060
In the image, what comes out is F-E-D, going the other way, and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.020
that's just because of how this correlation pulled it up.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.790
And it won't surprise you that it, not only does it flip it left and

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.470
right, it also flips it up and down.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.110
And that's what happens when you do a correlational filter of a impulse.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.230
Just because of the way you slide it over,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.030
you'll end up flipping that entire response.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.030
By the way, something that I was being implicit about is I was assuming that

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.900
this center of that filter was what we were calling the reference point, right.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.810
So wherever the center was located, wherever that center pixel.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.790
That was the one that was being entered into on the result.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.410
Okay.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.490
You could use a different point, but we're going to assume that the center pixel

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.770
is the reference pintal, pixel of the filter.
