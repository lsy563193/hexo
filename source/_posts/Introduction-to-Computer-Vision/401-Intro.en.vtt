00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.160
Okay, welcome back to computer vision.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.990
Now this is going to be our third lesson having to do with essentially how

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.160
intensity and shape, and light interact with one another.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.720
In the first one,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.460
we talked about the physics, in terms of how how that interaction works.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.460
In the second one, we talked about, what if you want to try to recover something

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.520
about the surface properties of the object, you know, the reflectance function.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.460
Basically, you have to make some assumptions about the shape, or, or

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.790
the illumination.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.650
Well, today we're going to turn around the other way and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.310
we're going to say, well, how can I recover something about the shape of

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.420
the object based upon what I'm seeing.
