00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.503
But suppose you don't know the radius.

00:00:02.503 --> 00:00:03.070
Okay?

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.040
Megan sent the postcard to the wrong place.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.519
You moved, because you wanted to upscale your apartment and

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.645
now you know you shouldn't have, because you're left without a radius.

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:12.680
So what do we do?

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.949
Well, let's think about it this way.

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:15.916
All right?

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:20.011
Now our Hough space has three dimensions, a, b and r,

00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:22.690
because we don't know what the radius.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.758
All right?

00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:27.161
So now if I have single point, what happens?

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:31.666
Well, now if we knew the radius, let's say, the radius was, I don't know, seven

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:35.736
over here, then it would be some sort of a circle centered about this point.

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:37.905
Right? Just like that we did before.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.965
And if the radius was let's say, three,

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:46.313
it would be another circle centered about the same point, but smaller.

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:51.131
So I hope you can start to see that what we're getting in here is

00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:53.087
actually a cone, okay?

00:00:53.087 --> 00:01:00.127
So with unknown radius, each point votes for an entire cone in this 3D space.

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:01.362
So the surface of the cone, right?

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:04.364
Not a filled in cone, but the cone that's a surface.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:06.300
And the next point, what does it do?

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.903
It votes for another cone and you can sum these all up.

00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:11.806
Now I will tell you this is pretty painful.

00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:15.222
And in fact, if any of you end up doing a problem set for some random course

00:01:15.222 --> 00:01:18.646
like this one, we're going to to tell you in terms of looking for circles.

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:23.050
If you try to vote in a great big 3D space, it's not going to work so well.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.661
And in a whole bunch of lectures later when we teach you about ransack,

00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:29.123
it'll sort of overcome this dimensionality.

00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:33.171
But for now, just know that we have this little problem of growing the size of

00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:34.195
the voting space.

00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:37.632
So it can be done, it's, it's just a little bit painful.

00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:42.005
But remember before, one of the ways we got rid of the number of

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.973
votes you had to do was by using the gradient direction?

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:47.174
Okay?

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:48.915
So because if like, I had a point and

00:01:48.915 --> 00:01:52.179
I knew the gradient, there was only one possible line it could be.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.615
Well, we can do the same thing with circles.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:58.052
All right? So now we have an unknown radius, but we have a gradient.

00:01:58.052 --> 00:01:58.986
All right?

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:02.324
So again, our Hough space is a, b and r.

00:02:02.324 --> 00:02:07.294
But this time, our one point here, it has this gradient.

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.262
Okay?

00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:10.851
Well, now if we knew the radius,

00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:14.835
we would just have one possible circle it could be.

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:15.369
Right?

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.831
So if you tell me that this is a point and that this is the gradient that I

00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:21.842
know the radius, that's the only place the center can be.

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:25.479
But if the radius was half that, then the center would be there.

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.182
Or the center, I guess it also could be on the other side.

00:02:28.182 --> 00:02:31.901
So it's just this single line of voting that can happen when you

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.722
have the gradient and that's drawn like that.

00:02:34.722 --> 00:02:38.397
So in the Hough space, even though it's a three dimensional Hough space,

00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:40.161
you would only vote along one line.

00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:40.728
Okay?

00:02:40.728 --> 00:02:43.964
And so that's a little bit better, at least it makes the voting easier.

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:47.030
You still have this problem when you have this three dimensional Hough space.
