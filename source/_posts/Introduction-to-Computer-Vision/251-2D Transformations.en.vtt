00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.110
So here, I have just I think this is a figure from Forsythe and Ponds.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.070
Maybe it's from Salinski.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.600
I hope their lawyers aren't watching.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.500
It's somebody.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.220
And basically, it talks about how you can transform an image.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.650
And so on the bottom left hand corner, you have a square.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.700
And you can see, you could just translate it.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.040
They, they call it Euclidean, but

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.470
that's just a rigid transformation where you have the rotation translation.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.320
You have similarity, affine, and projective, and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.640
we're going to talk about each of those in terms of the mathematics.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.180
So let's take the simplest example.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.060
So the simpi, the simplest example here is translation.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.910
So we have an x and, and by the way in, in this cool little figure.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.670
So the original x and y is the green box, and take our x and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.440
we just add some translation vector to it.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.500
And we saw that it was an easy way to describe this using

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.740
homogeneous coordinates where we just do xy and 1, and we add 1 to the end.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.750
And then we can just have a transformation matrix here, which is just made up of

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.600
an identity plus the translation vector that we add from over here.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.280
And to keep the whole thing in homogeneous coordinates, we would just say we

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.960
would make a, instead of a 2 by 3, would make this a 3 by 3.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.230
So that 0 vector now is on the bottom row.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.450
And what we do is we get from one homogeneous vector to another.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.980
Okay?

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.610
So that would be translation.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.290
By the way, because these are now just matrix multiplications,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.030
we could chain these transformations.
