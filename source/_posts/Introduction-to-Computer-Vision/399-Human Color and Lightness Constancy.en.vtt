00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.390
Color constancy is that the hue of something, the hue and

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.689
pretty much saturation, under different color, over different spectra or

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.200
color of lighting, you're still good at seeing.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.960
So, you know, you,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.930
you go outside and or you go inside where lights are different colors,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.090
and purple shirts look purple, green, green pants look green.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.220
Purple shirts and green pants together look bizarre.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.880
But you know, it's okay, you can still,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.270
you can still see it, regardless of the color of the illumination.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.240
The same thing, lightness constancy is like,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.920
what I was talking about the, the, the black piece of coal always looks black,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.790
even though more light is hitting your eye from the black piece of

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.470
coal outdoors, than from the white piece of paper indoors.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.830
So humans are very good at perceiving ,.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.870
What color a surface would have looked like if the light had

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.320
actually been white?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.660
So you sort of remove the effect of the illumination.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.200
We're pretty good at also being able to figure out what's

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.850
actually hitting our eyes, so you can say well it's a bluish thing, but

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.120
I actually see kind of a more purplish light coming in.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.380
You can sort of make that distinction.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.270
What humans are not so

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.560
good at is being able to tell you what the color of the light is,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.210
because they're brain is spending all this time trying to eliminate,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.990
the color of the light and they're not so good at being able to report that.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.940
So there are lots of methods that are used to try to

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.670
accomplish this kind of computationally.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.310
One method is.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.100
Let's suppose I don't know the color of a light, but

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.400
I want to render something well on, say, a color CCD image.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.320
Right?

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.930
Well, one thing you can do is you can say,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.440
let me assume that the average color is gray.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.150
That the average intensity is gray.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.570
And so those of you who have auto white balance on your cameras.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.420
And most of us with digital cameras do.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.090
It's essentially averaging over all that and saying.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.830
Let me take a look at all the different average color and

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.100
assume that it's really grey out there, so anything that's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.770
makes the whole average not grey is due to the illuminant and I'll change that.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.570
And it works okay it can sort of fail in that.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.800
So, you know that tungsten film, right, so

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.610
if you're, if you're, you know, if things aren't, aren't really great,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.490
you're ability to automatically do white balance, is really difficult.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.820
There's another really very simple method,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.280
assume that the brightest thing I see is white.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.740
So that way if the brightest thing I see is actually light blueish, I say okay,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.450
that was really supposed to be white.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.780
So I'm going to assume the light is kind of blue, and

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.160
I'll undo the blue light that's there.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.990
Okay, those of you that ever done, manual white balancing in cameras,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.320
you know that you put out a white card, or white piece of paper,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.250
you take an image of it, you say this is a white balance image, and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.860
you're telling it, this thing is really white, so

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.290
that any color that you see in there is because of the illuminant.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.260
Pull that out when you're doing the, when,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.610
when you're trying to do the color balancing.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.850
There are other things that say,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.330
I'm going to assume that the colors are supposed to span the entire color gamut.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.580
And so if I see the color sort of shifted, let me try to bring it back and

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.090
fill the whole gamut.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.180
So, these methods work sort of okay for photography because,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.290
it turns out that even if you get it a little wrong, your brain,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.480
when looking at the photograph, will often undo the right thing to begin with.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.020
But none of these methods really work well enough for

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.500
computer vision in order to analyze what's going on out there.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.800
It's still really an open problem.
