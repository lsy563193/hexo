00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.110
So what does R look like?

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.840
Well there are two ways to think about this,

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.320
first we'll think about it the hard way.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:15.280
R A to B expresses how each basis vector in A would be expressed in terms of B.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.460
So the first column of R A B is the component of the I

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.810
vector of A expressed in terms of how much it has in the i direction in B,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.560
in the j direction in B, and in the k direction in B.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.240
So you can think of it as like the dot product between i A, and

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.510
each of the components of B, i B, j B, k B.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.770
And likewise each of the following columns is done, is, is that way.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.838
So, one way of thinking about this is that the columns of

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:55.740
R A B are the i vector of A expressed in the B coordinate frame.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.420
Then the j vector of A in the B coordinate frame, and

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.660
the k vector of A in the B coordinate frame.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.830
All right, so why is this true?

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.740
Well let's think about it this way.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.927
Suppose I had a point, vector, in the A frame.

00:01:11.927 --> 00:01:17.230
That was just at value of 1, 0, 0, okay?

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.090
So what that means it's actually a distance of 1 in the i direction of

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.760
the A frame and none in the j and k of the A frame.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.870
What should the value of that be?

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.480
All right?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.450
And I'll just write that down here.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.180
Well, this multiplies this.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.400
This to that so.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.760
So it would just give me the iA dotted with iB.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.270
So the first component of the transformed frame is just the i vectors amount in,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.130
in the i direction of B.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.360
Well, now let's go through this.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.090
We go one, two, three.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.050
It's again, is going to get iA.jB.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.680
Okay, and again iA.kB.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.750
In other words it's just what it says here is what we have to

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.910
get out if we had just a 1, 0, 0,

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.250
needs to be how that vector is dotted which each of the components.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.010
And that's why this matrix can be thought of as having it's

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.110
column vectors as just being the each of the basis vectors of

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.460
the a frame expressed in terms of the b frame.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.730
Do you get that?

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.480
So on the sides you'll have that.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.770
So just press the pause button and that way you can.

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:38.220
See what's going on.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.850
Just to remind you I labeled this that the columns of

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.000
the rotation matrix are the axes of frame A expressed in frame B.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.370
Why? because we just went through all that nonsense showing it to you.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.580
By the way, it can also be thought of as the rows are just the column,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.790
are just the bases of the B vector expressed in the A frame, right?

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.550
So here's iB in, in the, in terms of the i component of A.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.160
Here's iB in terms of the j.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.510
Here's iB in k.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.010
So you think about this is that if I were to transpose that vector.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.882
So I made the columns the rows,

00:03:11.882 --> 00:03:17.230
the rows the columns, I would now have instead of RAB, I'd have RBA, all right?

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.120
This is an orthogonal matrix, right?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.840
The orthogonal matrix, all of the rows,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.960
all the columns are unit vectors that are perpendicular to each other.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.790
So the determinate so the, the magnets of determinate is 1.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.350
And it's your traditional rotation matrix and

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.300
by the way, really important is that the inverse is equal to the transpose.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.580
So, if you had a rotation matrix and you want to go back and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.340
forth between the two, the inverse and transpose, which realize it has to be.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.680
Because the inverse of RAB has to be RBA and we just showed how the,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.270
the rows are the sort of the transposed of the spec to the columns.
